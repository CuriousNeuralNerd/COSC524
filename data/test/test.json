        "content": "The Circular Staircase   CHAPTER I. I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE   This is the story of how a middle-aged spinster lost her mind, deserted her domestic gods in the city, took a furnished house for the summer out of town, and found herself involved in one of those mysterious crimes that keep our newspapers and detective agencies happy and prosperous. For twenty years I had been perfectly comfortable; for twenty years I had had the window-boxes filled in the spring, the carpets lifted, the awnings put up and the furniture covered with brown linen; for as many summers I had said good-by to my friends, and, after watching their perspiring hegira, had settled down to a delicious quiet in town, where the mail comes three times a day, and the water supply does not depend on a tank on the roof.  And then—the madness seized me. When I look back over the months I spent at Sunnyside, I wonder that I survived at all. As it is, I show the wear and tear of my harrowing experiences. I have turned very gray—Liddy reminded me of it, only yesterday, by saying that a little bluing in the rinse-water would make my hair silvery, instead of a yellowish white. I hate to be reminded of unpleasant things and I snapped her off.  “No,” I said sharply, “I’m not going to use bluing at my time of life, or starch, either.”  Liddy’s nerves are gone, she says, since that awful summer, but she has enough left, goodness knows! And when she begins to go around with a lump in her throat, all I have to do is to threaten to return to Sunnyside, and she is frightened into a semblance of cheerfulness,—from which you may judge that the summer there was anything but a success.  The newspaper accounts have been so garbled and incomplete—one of them mentioned me but once, and then only as the tenant at the time the thing happened—that I feel it my due to tell what I know. Mr. Jamieson, the detective, said himself he could never have done without me, although he gave me little enough credit, in print.  I shall have to go back several years—thirteen, to be exact—to start my story. At that time my brother died, leaving me his two children. Halsey was eleven then, and Gertrude was seven. All the responsibilities of maternity were thrust upon me suddenly; to perfect the profession of motherhood requires precisely as many years as the child has lived, like the man who started to carry the calf and ended by walking along with the bull on his shoulders. However, I did the best I could. When Gertrude got past the hair-ribbon age, and Halsey asked for a scarf-pin and put on long trousers—and a wonderful help that was to the darning!—I sent them away to good schools. After that, my responsibility was chiefly postal, with three months every summer in which to replenish their wardrobes, look over their lists of acquaintances, and generally to take my foster-motherhood out of its nine months’ retirement in camphor.  I missed the summers with them when, somewhat later, at boarding-school and college, the children spent much of their vacations with friends. Gradually I found that my name signed to a check was even more welcome than when signed to a letter, though I wrote them at stated intervals. But when Halsey had finished his electrical course and Gertrude her boarding-school, and both came home to stay, things were suddenly changed. The winter Gertrude came out was nothing but a succession of sitting up late at night to bring her home from things, taking her to the dressmakers between naps the next day, and discouraging ineligible youths with either more money than brains, or more brains than money. Also, I acquired a great many things: to say _lingerie_ for under-garments, “frocks” and “gowns” instead of dresses, and that beardless sophomores are not college boys, but college men. Halsey required less personal supervision, and as they both got their mother’s fortune that winter, my responsibility became purely moral. Halsey bought a car, of course, and I learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray baize veil, and, after a time, never to stop to look at the dogs one has run down. People are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs.  The additions to my education made me a properly equipped maiden aunt, and by spring I was quite tractable. So when Halsey suggested camping in the Adirondacks and Gertrude wanted Bar Harbor, we compromised on a good country house with links near, within motor distance of town and telephone distance of the doctor. That was how we went to Sunnyside.  We went out to inspect the property, and it seemed to deserve its name. Its cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of anything out of the ordinary. Only one thing seemed unusual to me: the housekeeper, who had been left in charge, had moved from the house to the gardener’s lodge, a few days before. As the lodge was far enough away from the house, it seemed to me that either fire or thieves could complete their work of destruction undisturbed. The property was an extensive one: the house on the top of a hill, which sloped away in great stretches of green lawn and clipped hedges, to the road; and across the valley, perhaps a couple of miles away, was the Greenwood Club House. Gertrude and Halsey were infatuated.  “Why, it’s everything you want,” Halsey said “View, air, good water and good roads. As for the house, it’s big enough for a hospital, if it has a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back,” which was ridiculous: it was pure Elizabethan.  Of course we took the place; it was not my idea of comfort, being much too large and sufficiently isolated to make the servant question serious. But I give myself credit for this: whatever has happened since, I never blamed Halsey and Gertrude for taking me there. And another thing: if the series of catastrophes there did nothing else, it taught me one thing—that somehow, somewhere, from perhaps a half-civilized ancestor who wore a sheepskin garment and trailed his food or his prey, I have in me the instinct of the chase. Were I a man I should be a trapper of criminals, trailing them as relentlessly as no doubt my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar. But being an unmarried woman, with the handicap of my sex, my first acquaintance with crime will probably be my last. Indeed, it came near enough to being my last acquaintance with anything.  The property was owned by Paul Armstrong, the president of the Traders’ Bank, who at the time we took the house was in the west with his wife and daughter, and a Doctor Walker, the Armstrong family physician. Halsey knew Louise Armstrong,—had been rather attentive to her the winter before, but as Halsey was always attentive to somebody, I had not thought of it seriously, although she was a charming girl. I knew of Mr. Armstrong only through his connection with the bank, where the children’s money was largely invested, and through an ugly story about the son, Arnold Armstrong, who was reported to have forged his father’s name, for a considerable amount, to some bank paper. However, the story had had no interest for me.  I cleared Halsey and Gertrude away to a house party, and moved out to Sunnyside the first of May. The roads were bad, but the trees were in leaf, and there were still tulips in the borders around the house. The arbutus was fragrant in the woods under the dead leaves, and on the way from the station, a short mile, while the car stuck in the mud, I found a bank showered with tiny forget-me-nots. The birds—don’t ask me what kind; they all look alike to me, unless they have a hall mark of some bright color—the birds were chirping in the hedges, and everything breathed of peace. Liddy, who was born and bred on a brick pavement, got a little bit down-spirited when the crickets began to chirp, or scrape their legs together, or whatever it is they do, at twilight.  The first night passed quietly enough. I have always been grateful for that one night’s peace; it shows what the country might be, under favorable circumstances. Never after that night did I put my head on my pillow with any assurance how long it would be there; or on my shoulders, for that matter.  On the following morning Liddy and Mrs. Ralston, my own housekeeper, had a difference of opinion, and Mrs. Ralston left on the eleven train. Just after luncheon, Burke, the butler, was taken unexpectedly with a pain in his right side, much worse when I was within hearing distance, and by afternoon he was started cityward. That night the cook’s sister had a baby—the cook, seeing indecision in my face, made it twins on second thought—and, to be short, by noon the next day the household staff was down to Liddy and myself. And this in a house with twenty-two rooms and five baths!  Liddy wanted to go back to the city at once, but the milk-boy said that Thomas Johnson, the Armstrongs’ colored butler, was working as a waiter at the Greenwood Club, and might come back. I have the usual scruples about coercing people’s servants away, but few of us have any conscience regarding institutions or corporations—witness the way we beat railroads and street-car companies when we can—so I called up the club, and about eight o’clock Thomas Johnson came to see me. Poor Thomas!  Well, it ended by my engaging Thomas on the spot, at outrageous wages, and with permission to sleep in the gardener’s lodge, empty since the house was rented. The old man—he was white-haired and a little stooped, but with an immense idea of his personal dignity—gave me his reasons hesitatingly.  “I ain’t sayin’ nothin’, Mis’ Innes,” he said, with his hand on the door-knob, “but there’s been goin’s-on here this las’ few months as ain’t natchal. ’Tain’t one thing an’ ’tain’t another—it’s jest a door squealin’ here, an’ a winder closin’ there, but when doors an’ winders gets to cuttin’ up capers and there’s nobody nigh ’em, it’s time Thomas Johnson sleeps somewhar’s else.”  Liddy, who seemed to be never more than ten feet away from me that night, and was afraid of her shadow in that great barn of a place, screamed a little, and turned a yellow-green. But I am not easily alarmed.  It was entirely in vain; I represented to Thomas that we were alone, and that he would have to stay in the house that night. He was politely firm, but he would come over early the next morning, and if I gave him a key, he would come in time to get some sort of breakfast. I stood on the huge veranda and watched him shuffle along down the shadowy drive, with mingled feelings—irritation at his cowardice and thankfulness at getting him at all. I am not ashamed to say that I double-locked the hall door when I went in.  “You can lock up the rest of the house and go to bed, Liddy,” I said severely. “You give me the creeps standing there. A woman of your age ought to have better sense.” It usually braces Liddy to mention her age: she owns to forty—which is absurd. Her mother cooked for my grandfather, and Liddy must be at least as old as I. But that night she refused to brace.  “You’re not going to ask me to lock up, Miss Rachel!” she quavered. “Why, there’s a dozen French windows in the drawing-room and the billiard-room wing, and every one opens on a porch. And Mary Anne said that last night there was a man standing by the stable when she locked the kitchen door.”  “Mary Anne was a fool,” I said sternly. “If there had been a man there, she would have had him in the kitchen and been feeding him what was left from dinner, inside of an hour, from force of habit. Now don’t be ridiculous. Lock up the house and go to bed. I am going to read.”   Illustration:  But Liddy set her lips tight and stood still.  “I’m not going to bed,” she said. “I am going to pack up, and to-morrow I am going to leave.”  “You’ll do nothing of the sort,” I snapped. Liddy and I often desire to part company, but never at the same time. “If you are afraid, I will go with you, but for goodness’ sake don’t try to hide behind me.”  The house was a typical summer residence on an extensive scale. Wherever possible, on the first floor, the architect had done away with partitions, using arches and columns instead. The effect was cool and spacious, but scarcely cozy. As Liddy and I went from one window to another, our voices echoed back at us uncomfortably. There was plenty of light—the electric plant down in the village supplied us—but there were long vistas of polished floor, and mirrors which reflected us from unexpected corners, until I felt some of Liddy’s foolishness communicate itself to me.  The house was very long, a rectangle in general form, with the main entrance in the center of the long side. The brick-paved entry opened into a short hall to the right of which, separated only by a row of pillars, was a huge living-room. Beyond that was the drawing-room, and in the end, the billiard-room. Off the billiard-room, in the extreme right wing, was a den, or card-room, with a small hall opening on the east veranda, and from there went up a narrow circular staircase. Halsey had pointed it out with delight.  “Just look, Aunt Rachel,” he said with a flourish. “The architect that put up this joint was wise to a few things. Arnold Armstrong and his friends could sit here and play cards all night and stumble up to bed in the early morning, without having the family send in a police call.”  Liddy and I got as far as the card-room and turned on all the lights. I tried the small entry door there, which opened on the veranda, and examined the windows. Everything was secure, and Liddy, a little less nervous now, had just pointed out to me the disgracefully dusty condition of the hard-wood floor, when suddenly the lights went out. We waited a moment; I think Liddy was stunned with fright, or she would have screamed. And then I clutched her by the arm and pointed to one of the windows opening on the porch. The sudden change threw the window into relief, an oblong of grayish light, and showed us a figure standing close, peering in. As I looked it darted across the veranda and out of sight in the darkness.     CHAPTER II. A LINK CUFF-BUTTON   Liddy’s knees seemed to give away under her. Without a sound she sank down, leaving me staring at the window in petrified amazement. Liddy began to moan under her breath, and in my excitement I reached down and shook her.  “Stop it,” I whispered. “It’s only a woman—maybe a maid of the Armstrongs’. Get up and help me find the door.” She groaned again. “Very well,” I said, “then I’ll have to leave you here. I’m going.”  She moved at that, and, holding to my sleeve, we felt our way, with numerous collisions, to the billiard-room, and from there to the drawing-room. The lights came on then, and, with the long French windows unshuttered, I had a creepy feeling that each one sheltered a peering face. In fact, in the light of what happened afterward, I am pretty certain we were under surveillance during the entire ghostly evening. We hurried over the rest of the locking-up and got upstairs as quickly as we could. I left the lights all on, and our footsteps echoed cavernously. Liddy had a stiff neck the next morning, from looking back over her shoulder, and she refused to go to bed.  “Let me stay in your dressing-room, Miss Rachel,” she begged. “If you don’t, I’ll sit in the hall outside the door. I’m not going to be murdered with my eyes shut.”  “If you’re going to be murdered,” I retorted, “it won’t make any difference whether they are shut or open. But you may stay in the dressing-room, if you will lie on the couch: when you sleep in a chair you snore.”  She was too far gone to be indignant, but after a while she came to the door and looked in to where I was composing myself for sleep with Drummond’s _Spiritual Life_.  “That wasn’t a woman, Miss Rachel,” she said, with her shoes in her hand. “It was a man in a long coat.”  “What woman was a man?” I discouraged her without looking up, and she went back to the couch.  It was eleven o’clock when I finally prepared for bed. In spite of my assumption of indifference, I locked the door into the hall, and finding the transom did not catch, I put a chair cautiously before the door—it was not necessary to rouse Liddy—and climbing up put on the ledge of the transom a small dressing-mirror, so that any movement of the frame would send it crashing down. Then, secure in my precautions, I went to bed.  I did not go to sleep at once. Liddy disturbed me just as I was growing drowsy, by coming in and peering under the bed. She was afraid to speak, however, because of her previous snubbing, and went back, stopping in the doorway to sigh dismally.  Somewhere down-stairs a clock with a chime sang away the hours—eleven-thirty, forty-five, twelve. And then the lights went out to stay. The Casanova Electric Company shuts up shop and goes home to bed at midnight: when one has a party, I believe it is customary to fee the company, which will drink hot coffee and keep awake a couple of hours longer. But the lights were gone for good that night. Liddy had gone to sleep, as I knew she would. She was a very unreliable person: always awake and ready to talk when she wasn’t wanted and dozing off to sleep when she was. I called her once or twice, the only result being an explosive snore that threatened her very windpipe—then I got up and lighted a bedroom candle.  My bedroom and dressing room were above the big living-room on the first floor. On the second floor a long corridor ran the length of the house, with rooms opening from both sides. In the wings were small corridors crossing the main one—the plan was simplicity itself. And just as I got back into bed, I heard a sound from the east wing, apparently, that made me stop, frozen, with one bedroom slipper half off, and listen. It was a rattling metallic sound, and it reverberated along the empty halls like the crash of doom. It was for all the world as if something heavy, perhaps a piece of steel, had rolled clattering and jangling down the hard-wood stairs leading to the card-room.  In the silence that followed Liddy stirred and snored again. I was exasperated: first she kept me awake by silly alarms, then when she was needed she slept like Joe Jefferson, or Rip,—they are always the same to me. I went in and aroused her, and I give her credit for being wide awake the minute I spoke.  “Get up,” I said, “if you don’t want to be murdered in your bed.”  “Where? How?” she yelled vociferously, and jumped up.  “There’s somebody in the house,” I said. “Get up. We’ll have to get to the telephone.”  “Not out in the hall!” she gasped; “Oh, Miss Rachel, not out in the hall!” trying to hold me back. But I am a large woman and Liddy is small. We got to the door, somehow, and Liddy held a brass andiron, which it was all she could do to lift, let alone brain anybody with. I listened, and, hearing nothing, opened the door a little and peered into the hall. It was a black void, full of terrible suggestion, and my candle only emphasized the gloom. Liddy squealed and drew me back again, and as the door slammed, the mirror I had put on the transom came down and hit her on the head. That completed our demoralization. It was some time before I could persuade her she had not been attacked from behind by a burglar, and when she found the mirror smashed on the floor she wasn’t much better.  “There’s going to be a death!” she wailed. “Oh, Miss Rachel, there’s going to be a death!”  “There will be,” I said grimly, “if you don’t keep quiet, Liddy Allen.”  And so we sat there until morning, wondering if the candle would last until dawn, and arranging what trains we could take back to town. If we had only stuck to that decision and gone back before it was too late!  The sun came finally, and from my window I watched the trees along the drive take shadowy form, gradually lose their ghostlike appearance, become gray and then green. The Greenwood Club showed itself a dab of white against the hill across the valley, and an early robin or two hopped around in the dew. Not until the milk-boy and the sun came, about the same time, did I dare to open the door into the hall and look around. Everything was as we had left it. Trunks were heaped here and there, ready for the trunk-room, and through an end window of stained glass came a streak of red and yellow daylight that was eminently cheerful. The milk-boy was pounding somewhere below, and the day had begun.  Thomas Johnson came ambling up the drive about half-past six, and we could hear him clattering around on the lower floor, opening shutters. I had to take Liddy to her room up-stairs, however,—she was quite sure she would find something uncanny. In fact, when she did not, having now the courage of daylight, she was actually disappointed.  Well, we did not go back to town that day.  The discovery of a small picture fallen from the wall of the drawing-room was quite sufficient to satisfy Liddy that the alarm had been a false one, but I was anything but convinced. Allowing for my nerves and the fact that small noises magnify themselves at night, there was still no possibility that the picture had made the series of sounds I heard. To prove it, however, I dropped it again. It fell with a single muffled crash of its wooden frame, and incidentally ruined itself beyond repair. I justified myself by reflecting that if the Armstrongs chose to leave pictures in unsafe positions, and to rent a house with a family ghost, the destruction of property was their responsibility, not mine.  I warned Liddy not to mention what had happened to anybody, and telephoned to town for servants. Then after a breakfast which did more credit to Thomas’ heart than his head, I went on a short tour of investigation. The sounds had come from the east wing, and not without some qualms I began there. At first I found nothing. Since then I have developed my powers of observation, but at that time I was a novice. The small card-room seemed undisturbed. I looked for footprints, which is, I believe, the conventional thing to do, although my experience has been that as clues both footprints and thumb-marks are more useful in fiction than in fact. But the stairs in that wing offered something.  At the top of the flight had been placed a tall wicker hamper, packed, with linen that had come from town. It stood at the edge of the top step, almost barring passage, and on the step below it was a long fresh scratch. For three steps the scratch was repeated, gradually diminishing, as if some object had fallen, striking each one. Then for four steps nothing. On the fifth step below was a round dent in the hard wood. That was all, and it seemed little enough, except that I was positive the marks had not been there the day before.  It bore out my theory of the sound, which had been for all the world like the bumping of a metallic object down a flight of steps. The four steps had been skipped. I reasoned that an iron bar, for instance, would do something of the sort,—strike two or three steps, end down, then turn over, jumping a few stairs, and landing with a thud.  Iron bars, however, do not fall down-stairs in the middle of the night alone. Coupled with the figure on the veranda the agency by which it climbed might be assumed. But—and here was the thing that puzzled me most—the doors were all fastened that morning, the windows unmolested, and the particular door from the card-room to the veranda had a combination lock of which I held the key, and which had not been tampered with.  I fixed on an attempt at burglary, as the most natural explanation—an attempt frustrated by the falling of the object, whatever it was, that had roused me. Two things I could not understand: how the intruder had escaped with everything locked, and why he had left the small silver, which, in the absence of a butler, had remained down-stairs over night.  Under pretext of learning more about the place, Thomas Johnson led me through the house and the cellars, without result. Everything was in good order and repair; money had been spent lavishly on construction and plumbing. The house was full of conveniences, and I had no reason to repent my bargain, save the fact that, in the nature of things, night must come again. And other nights must follow—and we were a long way from a police-station.  In the afternoon a hack came up from Casanova, with a fresh relay of servants. The driver took them with a flourish to the servants’ entrance, and drove around to the front of the house, where I was awaiting him.  “Two dollars,” he said in reply to my question. “I don’t charge full rates, because, bringin’ ’em up all summer as I do, it pays to make a special price. When they got off the train, I sez, sez I, ‘There’s another bunch for Sunnyside, cook, parlor maid and all.’ Yes’m—six summers, and a new lot never less than once a month. They won’t stand for the country and the lonesomeness, I reckon.”  But with the presence of the “bunch” of servants my courage revived, and late in the afternoon came a message from Gertrude that she and Halsey would arrive that night at about eleven o’clock, coming in the car from Richfield. Things were looking up; and when Beulah, my cat, a most intelligent animal, found some early catnip on a bank near the house and rolled in it in a feline ecstasy, I decided that getting back to nature was the thing to do.  While I was dressing for dinner, Liddy rapped at the door. She was hardly herself yet, but privately I think she was worrying about the broken mirror and its augury, more than anything else. When she came in she was holding something in her hand, and she laid it on the dressing-table carefully.  “I found it in the linen hamper,” she said. “It must be Mr. Halsey’s, but it seems queer how it got there.”  It was the half of a link cuff-button of unique design, and I looked at it carefully.  “Where was it? In the bottom of the hamper?” I asked.  “On the very top,” she replied. “It’s a mercy it didn’t fall out on the way.”  When Liddy had gone I examined the fragment attentively. I had never seen it before, and I was certain it was not Halsey’s. It was of Italian workmanship, and consisted of a mother-of-pearl foundation, encrusted with tiny seed-pearls, strung on horsehair to hold them. In the center was a small ruby. The trinket was odd enough, but not intrinsically of great value. Its interest for me lay in this: Liddy had found it lying in the top of the hamper which had blocked the east-wing stairs.  That afternoon the Armstrongs’ housekeeper, a youngish good-looking woman, applied for Mrs. Ralston’s place, and I was glad enough to take her. She looked as though she might be equal to a dozen of Liddy, with her snapping black eyes and heavy jaw. Her name was Anne Watson, and I dined that evening for the first time in three days.     CHAPTER III. MR. JOHN BAILEY APPEARS   I had dinner served in the breakfast-room. Somehow the huge dining-room depressed me, and Thomas, cheerful enough all day, allowed his spirits to go down with the sun. He had a habit of watching the corners of the room, left shadowy by the candles on the table, and altogether it was not a festive meal.  Dinner over I went into the living-room. I had three hours before the children could possibly arrive, and I got out my knitting. I had brought along two dozen pairs of slipper soles in assorted sizes—I always send knitted slippers to the Old Ladies’ Home at Christmas—and now I sorted over the wools with a grim determination not to think about the night before. But my mind was not on my work: at the end of a half-hour I found I had put a row of blue scallops on Eliza Klinefelter’s lavender slippers, and I put them away.  I got out the cuff-link and went with it to the pantry. Thomas was wiping silver and the air was heavy with tobacco smoke. I sniffed and looked around, but there was no pipe to be seen.  “Thomas,” I said, “you have been smoking.”  “No, ma’m.” He was injured innocence itself. “It’s on my coat, ma’m. Over at the club the gentlemen—”  But Thomas did not finish. The pantry was suddenly filled with the odor of singeing cloth. Thomas gave a clutch at his coat, whirled to the sink, filled a tumbler with water and poured it into his right pocket with the celerity of practice.  “Thomas,” I said, when he was sheepishly mopping the floor, “smoking is a filthy and injurious habit. If you must smoke, you must; but don’t stick a lighted pipe in your pocket again. Your skin’s your own: you can blister it if you like. But this house is not mine, and I don’t want a conflagration. Did you ever see this cuff-link before?”  No, he never had, he said, but he looked at it oddly.  “I picked it up in the hall,” I added indifferently. The old man’s eyes were shrewd under his bushy eyebrows.  “There’s strange goin’s-on here, Mis’ Innes,” he said, shaking his head. “Somethin’s goin’ to happen, sure. You ain’t took notice that the big clock in the hall is stopped, I reckon?”  “Nonsense,” I said. “Clocks have to stop, don’t they, if they’re not wound?”  “It’s wound up, all right, and it stopped at three o’clock last night,” he answered solemnly. “More’n that, that there clock ain’t stopped for fifteen years, not since Mr. Armstrong’s first wife died. And that ain’t all,—no _ma’m_. Last three nights I slep’ in this place, after the electrics went out I had a token. My oil lamp was full of oil, but it kep’ goin’ out, do what I would. Minute I shet my eyes, out that lamp’d go. There ain’t no surer token of death. The Bible sez, _Let yer light shine!_ When a hand you can’t see puts yer light out, it means death, sure.”  The old man’s voice was full of conviction. In spite of myself I had a chilly sensation in the small of my back, and I left him mumbling over his dishes. Later on I heard a crash from the pantry, and Liddy reported that Beulah, who is coal black, had darted in front of Thomas just as he picked up a tray of dishes; that the bad omen had been too much for him, and he had dropped the tray.  The chug of the automobile as it climbed the hill was the most welcome sound I had heard for a long time, and with Gertrude and Halsey actually before me, my troubles seemed over for good. Gertrude stood smiling in the hall, with her hat quite over one ear, and her hair in every direction under her pink veil. Gertrude is a very pretty girl, no matter how her hat is, and I was not surprised when Halsey presented a good-looking young man, who bowed at me and looked at Trude—that is the ridiculous nickname Gertrude brought from school.  “I have brought a guest, Aunt Ray,” Halsey said. “I want you to adopt him into your affections and your Saturday-to-Monday list. Let me present John Bailey, only you must call him Jack. In twelve hours he’ll be calling you ‘Aunt’: I know him.”  We shook hands, and I got a chance to look at Mr. Bailey; he was a tall fellow, perhaps thirty, and he wore a small mustache. I remember wondering why: he seemed to have a good mouth and when he smiled his teeth were above the average. One never knows why certain men cling to a messy upper lip that must get into things, any more than one understands some women building up their hair on wire atrocities. Otherwise, he was very good to look at, stalwart and tanned, with the direct gaze that I like. I am particular about Mr. Bailey, because he was a prominent figure in what happened later.  Gertrude was tired with the trip and went up to bed very soon. I made up my mind to tell them nothing until the next day, and then to make as light of our excitement as possible. After all, what had I to tell? An inquisitive face peering in at a window; a crash in the night; a scratch or two on the stairs, and half a cuff-button! As for Thomas and his forebodings, it was always my belief that a negro is one part thief, one part pigment, and the rest superstition.  It was Saturday night. The two men went to the billiard-room, and I could hear them talking as I went up-stairs. It seemed that Halsey had stopped at the Greenwood Club for gasolene and found Jack Bailey there, with the Sunday golf crowd. Mr. Bailey had not been hard to persuade—probably Gertrude knew why—and they had carried him off triumphantly. I roused Liddy to get them something to eat—Thomas was beyond reach in the lodge—and paid no attention to her evident terror of the kitchen regions. Then I went to bed. The men were still in the billiard-room when I finally dozed off, and the last thing I remember was the howl of a dog in front of the house. It wailed a crescendo of woe that trailed off hopefully, only to break out afresh from a new point of the compass.  At three o’clock in the morning I was roused by a revolver shot. The sound seemed to come from just outside my door. For a moment I could not move. Then—I heard Gertrude stirring in her room, and the next moment she had thrown open the connecting door.  “O Aunt Ray! Aunt Ray!” she cried hysterically. “Some one has been killed, killed!”  “Thieves,” I said shortly. “Thank goodness, there are some men in the house to-night.” I was getting into my slippers and a bath-robe, and Gertrude with shaking hands was lighting a lamp. Then we opened the door into the hall, where, crowded on the upper landing of the stairs, the maids, white-faced and trembling, were peering down, headed by Liddy. I was greeted by a series of low screams and questions, and I tried to quiet them.  Gertrude had dropped on a chair and sat there limp and shivering.  I went at once across the hall to Halsey’s room and knocked; then I pushed the door open. It was empty; the bed had not been occupied!  “He must be in Mr. Bailey’s room,” I said excitedly, and followed by Liddy, we went there. Like Halsey’s, it had not been occupied! Gertrude was on her feet now, but she leaned against the door for support.  “They have been killed!” she gasped. Then she caught me by the arm and dragged me toward the stairs. “They may only be hurt, and we must find them,” she said, her eyes dilated with excitement.  I don’t remember how we got down the stairs: I do remember expecting every moment to be killed. The cook was at the telephone up-stairs, calling the Greenwood Club, and Liddy was behind me, afraid to come and not daring to stay behind. We found the living-room and the drawing-room undisturbed. Somehow I felt that whatever we found would be in the card-room or on the staircase, and nothing but the fear that Halsey was in danger drove me on; with every step my knees seemed to give way under me. Gertrude was ahead and in the card-room she stopped, holding her candle high. Then she pointed silently to the doorway into the hall beyond. Huddled there on the floor, face down, with his arms extended, was a man.  Gertrude ran forward with a gasping sob. “Jack,” she cried, “oh, Jack!”  Liddy had run, screaming, and the two of us were there alone. It was Gertrude who turned him over, finally, until we could see his white face, and then she drew a deep breath and dropped limply to her knees. It was the body of a man, a gentleman, in a dinner coat and white waistcoat, stained now with blood—the body of a man I had never seen before.     CHAPTER IV. WHERE IS HALSEY?   Gertrude gazed at the face in a kind of fascination. Then she put out her hands blindly, and I thought she was going to faint.  “He has killed him!” she muttered almost inarticulately; and at that, because my nerves were going, I gave her a good shake.  “What do you mean?” I said frantically. There was a depth of grief and conviction in her tone that was worse than anything she could have said. The shake braced her, anyhow, and she seemed to pull herself together. But not another word would she say: she stood gazing down at that gruesome figure on the floor, while Liddy, ashamed of her flight and afraid to come back alone, drove before her three terrified women-servants into the drawing-room, which was as near as any of them would venture.  Once in the drawing-room, Gertrude collapsed and went from one fainting spell into another. I had all I could do to keep Liddy from drowning her with cold water, and the maids huddled in a corner, as much use as so many sheep. In a short time, although it seemed hours, a car came rushing up, and Anne Watson, who had waited to dress, opened the door. Three men from the Greenwood Club, in all kinds of costumes, hurried in. I recognized a Mr. Jarvis, but the others were strangers.  “What’s wrong?” the Jarvis man asked—and we made a strange picture, no doubt. “Nobody hurt, is there?” He was looking at Gertrude.  “Worse than that, Mr. Jarvis,” I said. “I think it is murder.”  At the word there was a commotion. The cook began to cry, and Mrs. Watson knocked over a chair. The men were visibly impressed.  “Not any member of the family?” Mr. Jarvis asked, when he had got his breath.  “No,” I said; and motioning Liddy to look after Gertrude, I led the way with a lamp to the card-room door. One of the men gave an exclamation, and they all hurried across the room. Mr. Jarvis took the lamp from me—I remember that—and then, feeling myself getting dizzy and light-headed, I closed my eyes. When I opened them their brief examination was over, and Mr. Jarvis was trying to put me in a chair.  “You must get up-stairs,” he said firmly, “you and Miss Gertrude, too. This has been a terrible shock. In his own home, too.”  I stared at him without comprehension. “Who is it?” I asked with difficulty. There was a band drawn tight around my throat.  “It is Arnold Armstrong,” he said, looking at me oddly, “and he has been murdered in his father’s house.”  After a minute I gathered myself together and Mr. Jarvis helped me into the living-room. Liddy had got Gertrude up-stairs, and the two strange men from the club stayed with the body. The reaction from the shock and strain was tremendous: I was collapsed—and then Mr. Jarvis asked me a question that brought back my wandering faculties.  “Where is Halsey?” he asked.  “Halsey!” Suddenly Gertrude’s stricken face rose before me the empty rooms up-stairs. Where was Halsey?  “He was here, wasn’t he?” Mr. Jarvis persisted. “He stopped at the club on his way over.”  “I—don’t know where he is,” I said feebly.  One of the men from the club came in, asked for the telephone, and I could hear him excitedly talking, saying something about coroners and detectives. Mr. Jarvis leaned over to me.  “Why don’t you trust me, Miss Innes?” he said. “If I can do anything I will. But tell me the whole thing.”  I did, finally, from the beginning, and when I told of Jack Bailey’s being in the house that night, he gave a long whistle.  “I wish they were both here,” he said when I finished. “Whatever mad prank took them away, it would look better if they were here. Especially—”  “Especially what?”  “Especially since Jack Bailey and Arnold Armstrong were notoriously bad friends. It was Bailey who got Arnold into trouble last spring—something about the bank. And then, too—”  “Go on,” I said. “If there is anything more, I ought to know.”  “There’s nothing more,” he said evasively. “There’s just one thing we may bank on, Miss Innes. Any court in the country will acquit a man who kills an intruder in his house, at night. If Halsey—”  “Why, you don’t think Halsey did it!” I exclaimed. There was a queer feeling of physical nausea coming over me.  “No, no, not at all,” he said with forced cheerfulness. “Come, Miss Innes, you’re a ghost of yourself and I am going to help you up-stairs and call your maid. This has been too much for you.”  Liddy helped me back to bed, and under the impression that I was in danger of freezing to death, put a hot-water bottle over my heart and another at my feet. Then she left me. It was early dawn now, and from voices under my window I surmised that Mr. Jarvis and his companions were searching the grounds. As for me, I lay in bed, with every faculty awake. Where had Halsey gone? How had he gone, and when? Before the murder, no doubt, but who would believe that? If either he or Jack Bailey had heard an intruder in the house and shot him—as they might have been justified in doing—why had they run away? The whole thing was unheard of, outrageous, and—impossible to ignore.  About six o’clock Gertrude came in. She was fully dressed, and I sat up nervously.  “Poor Aunty!” she said. “What a shocking night you have had!” She came over and sat down on the bed, and I saw she looked very tired and worn.  “Is there anything new?” I asked anxiously.  “Nothing. The car is gone, but Warner”—he is the chauffeur—“Warner is at the lodge and knows nothing about it.”  “Well,” I said, “if I ever get my hands on Halsey Innes, I shall not let go until I have told him a few things. When we get this cleared up, I am going back to the city to be quiet. One more night like the last two will end me. The peace of the country—fiddle sticks!”  Whereupon I told Gertrude of the noises the night before, and the figure on the veranda in the east wing. As an afterthought I brought out the pearl cuff-link.  “I have no doubt now,” I said, “that it was Arnold Armstrong the night before last, too. He had a key, no doubt, but why he should steal into his father’s house I can not imagine. He could have come with my permission, easily enough. Anyhow, whoever it was that night, left this little souvenir.”  Gertrude took one look at the cuff-link, and went as white as the pearls in it; she clutched at the foot of the bed, and stood staring. As for me, I was quite as astonished as she was.  “Where did—you—find it?” she asked finally, with a desperate effort at calm. And while I told her she stood looking out of the window with a look I could not fathom on her face. It was a relief when Mrs. Watson tapped at the door and brought me some tea and toast. The cook was in bed, completely demoralized, she reported, and Liddy, brave with the daylight, was looking for footprints around the house. Mrs. Watson herself was a wreck; she was blue-white around the lips, and she had one hand tied up.  She said she had fallen down-stairs in her excitement. It was natural, of course, that the thing would shock her, having been the Armstrongs’ housekeeper for several years, and knowing Mr. Arnold well.  Gertrude had slipped out during my talk with Mrs. Watson, and I dressed and went down-stairs. The billiard and card-rooms were locked until the coroner and the detectives got there, and the men from the club had gone back for more conventional clothing.  I could hear Thomas in the pantry, alternately wailing for Mr. Arnold, as he called him, and citing the tokens that had precursed the murder. The house seemed to choke me, and, slipping a shawl around me, I went out on the drive. At the corner by the east wing I met Liddy. Her skirts were draggled with dew to her knees, and her hair was still in crimps.  “Go right in and change your clothes,” I said sharply. “You’re a sight, and at your age!”  She had a golf-stick in her hand, and she said she had found it on the lawn. There was nothing unusual about it, but it occurred to me that a golf-stick with a metal end might have been the object that had scratched the stairs near the card-room. I took it from her, and sent her up for dry garments. Her daylight courage and self-importance, and her shuddering delight in the mystery, irritated me beyond words. After I left her I made a circuit of the building. Nothing seemed to be disturbed: the house looked as calm and peaceful in the morning sun as it had the day I had been coerced into taking it. There was nothing to show that inside had been mystery and violence and sudden death.  In one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird was pecking viciously at something that glittered in the light. I picked my way gingerly over through the dew and stooped down: almost buried in the soft ground was a revolver! I scraped the earth off it with the tip of my shoe, and, picking it up, slipped it into my pocket. Not until I had got into my bedroom and double-locked the door did I venture to take it out and examine it. One look was all I needed. It was Halsey’s revolver. I had unpacked it the day before and put it on his shaving-stand, and there could be no mistake. His name was on a small silver plate on the handle.  I seemed to see a network closing around my boy, innocent as I knew he was. The revolver—I am afraid of them, but anxiety gave me courage to look through the barrel—the revolver had still two bullets in it. I could only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that I had found the revolver before any sharp-eyed detective had come around.  I decided to keep what clues I had, the cuff-link, the golf-stick and the revolver, in a secure place until I could see some reason for displaying them. The cuff-link had been dropped into a little filigree box on my toilet table. I opened the box and felt around for it. The box was empty—the cuff-link had disappeared!     CHAPTER V. GERTRUDE’S ENGAGEMENT   At ten o’clock the Casanova hack brought up three men. They introduced themselves as the coroner of the county and two detectives from the city. The coroner led the way at once to the locked wing, and with the aid of one of the detectives examined the rooms and the body. The other detective, after a short scrutiny of the dead man, busied himself with the outside of the house. It was only after they had got a fair idea of things as they were that they sent for me.  I received them in the living-room, and I had made up my mind exactly what to tell. I had taken the house for the summer, I said, while the Armstrongs were in California. In spite of a rumor among the servants about strange noises—I cited Thomas—nothing had occurred the first two nights. On the third night I believed that some one had been in the house: I had heard a crashing sound, but being alone with one maid had not investigated. The house had been locked in the morning and apparently undisturbed.  Then, as clearly as I could, I related how, the night before, a shot had roused us; that my niece and I had investigated and found a body; that I did not know who the murdered man was until Mr. Jarvis from the club informed me, and that I knew of no reason why Mr. Arnold Armstrong should steal into his father’s house at night. I should have been glad to allow him entree there at any time.  “Have you reason to believe, Miss Innes,” the coroner asked, “that any member of your household, imagining Mr. Armstrong was a burglar, shot him in self-defense?”  “I have no reason for thinking so,” I said quietly.  “Your theory is that Mr. Armstrong was followed here by some enemy, and shot as he entered the house?”  “I don’t think I have a theory,” I said. “The thing that has puzzled me is why Mr. Armstrong should enter his father’s house two nights in succession, stealing in like a thief, when he needed only to ask entrance to be admitted.”  The coroner was a very silent man: he took some notes after this, but he seemed anxious to make the next train back to town. He set the inquest for the following Saturday, gave Mr. Jamieson, the younger of the two detectives, and the more intelligent looking, a few instructions, and, after gravely shaking hands with me and regretting the unfortunate affair, took his departure, accompanied by the other detective.  I was just beginning to breathe freely when Mr. Jamieson, who had been standing by the window, came over to me.  “The family consists of yourself alone, Miss Innes?”  “My niece is here,” I said.  “There is no one but yourself and your niece?”  “My nephew.” I had to moisten my lips.  “Oh, a nephew. I should like to see him, if he is here.”  “He is not here just now,” I said as quietly as I could. “I expect him—at any time.”  “He was here yesterday evening, I believe?”  “No—yes.”  “Didn’t he have a guest with him? Another man?”  “He brought a friend with him to stay over Sunday, Mr. Bailey.”  “Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the Traders’ Bank I believe.” And I knew that some one at the Greenwood Club had told. “When did they leave?”  “Very early—I don’t know at just what time.”  Mr. Jamieson turned suddenly and looked at me.  “Please try to be more explicit,” he said. “You say your nephew and Mr. Bailey were in the house last night, and yet you and your niece, with some women-servants, found the body. Where was your nephew?”  I was entirely desperate by that time.  “I do not know,” I cried, “but be sure of this: Halsey knows nothing of this thing, and no amount of circumstantial evidence can make an innocent man guilty.”  “Sit down,” he said, pushing forward a chair. “There are some things I have to tell you, and, in return, please tell me all you know. Believe me, things always come out. In the first place, Mr. Armstrong was shot from above. The bullet was fired at close range, entered below the shoulder and came out, after passing through the heart, well down the back. In other words, I believe the murderer stood on the stairs and fired down. In the second place, I found on the edge of the billiard-table a charred cigar which had burned itself partly out, and a cigarette which had consumed itself to the cork tip. Neither one had been more than lighted, then put down and forgotten. Have you any idea what it was that made your nephew and Mr. Bailey leave their cigars and their game, take out the automobile without calling the chauffeur, and all this at—let me see—certainly before three o’clock in the morning?”  “I don’t know,” I said; “but depend on it, Mr. Jamieson, Halsey will be back himself to explain everything.”  “I sincerely hope so,” he said. “Miss Innes, has it occurred to you that Mr. Bailey might know something of this?”  Gertrude had come down-stairs and just as he spoke she came in. I saw her stop suddenly, as if she had been struck.  “He does not,” she said in a tone that was not her own. “Mr. Bailey and my brother know nothing of this. The murder was committed at three. They left the house at a quarter before three.”  “How do you know that?” Mr. Jamieson asked oddly. “Do you _know_ at what time they left?”  “I do,” Gertrude answered firmly. “At a quarter before three my brother and Mr. Bailey left the house, by the main entrance. I—was—there.”  “Gertrude,” I said excitedly, “you are dreaming! Why, at a quarter to three—”  “Listen,” she said. “At half-past two the downstairs telephone rang. I had not gone to sleep, and I heard it. Then I heard Halsey answer it, and in a few minutes he came up-stairs and knocked at my door. We—we talked for a minute, then I put on my dressing-gown and slippers, and went down-stairs with him. Mr. Bailey was in the billiard-room. We—we all talked together for perhaps ten minutes. Then it was decided that—that they should both go away—”  “Can’t you be more explicit?” Mr. Jamieson asked. “_Why_ did they go away?”  “I am only telling you what happened, not why it happened,” she said evenly. “Halsey went for the car, and instead of bringing it to the house and rousing people, he went by the lower road from the stable. Mr. Bailey was to meet him at the foot of the lawn. Mr. Bailey left—”  “Which way?” Mr. Jamieson asked sharply.  “By the main entrance. He left—it was a quarter to three. I know exactly.”  “The clock in the hall is stopped, Miss Innes,” said Jamieson. Nothing seemed to escape him.  “He looked at his watch,” she replied, and I could see Mr. Jamieson’s snap, as if he had made a discovery. As for myself, during the whole recital I had been plunged into the deepest amazement.  “Will you pardon me for a personal question?” The detective was a youngish man, and I thought he was somewhat embarrassed. “What are your—your relations with Mr. Bailey?”  Gertrude hesitated. Then she came over and put her hand lovingly in mine.  “I am engaged to marry him,” she said simply.  I had grown so accustomed to surprises that I could only gasp again, and as for Gertrude, the hand that lay in mine was burning with fever.  “And—after that,” Mr. Jamieson went on, “you went directly to bed?”  Gertrude hesitated.  “No,” she said finally. “I—I am not nervous, and after I had extinguished the light, I remembered something I had left in the billiard-room, and I felt my way back there through the darkness.”  “Will you tell me what it was you had forgotten?”  “I can not tell you,” she said slowly. “I—I did not leave the billiard-room at once—”  “Why?” The detective’s tone was imperative. “This is very important, Miss Innes.”  “I was crying,” Gertrude said in a low tone. “When the French clock in the drawing-room struck three, I got up, and then—I heard a step on the east porch, just outside the card-room. Some one with a key was working with the latch, and I thought, of course, of Halsey. When we took the house he called that his entrance, and he had carried a key for it ever since. The door opened and I was about to ask what he had forgotten, when there was a flash and a report. Some heavy body dropped, and, half crazed with terror and shock, I ran through the drawing-room and got up-stairs—I scarcely remember how.”  She dropped into a chair, and I thought Mr. Jamieson must have finished. But he was not through.  “You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Bailey admirably,” he said. “The testimony is invaluable, especially in view of the fact that your brother and Mr. Armstrong had, I believe, quarreled rather seriously some time ago.”  “Nonsense,” I broke in. “Things are bad enough, Mr. Jamieson, without inventing bad feeling where it doesn’t exist. Gertrude, I don’t think Halsey knew the—the murdered man, did he?”  But Mr. Jamieson was sure of his ground.  “The quarrel, I believe,” he persisted, “was about Mr. Armstrong’s conduct to you, Miss Gertrude. He had been paying you unwelcome attentions.”  And I had never seen the man!  When she nodded a “yes” I saw the tremendous possibilities involved. If this detective could prove that Gertrude feared and disliked the murdered man, and that Mr. Armstrong had been annoying and possibly pursuing her with hateful attentions, all that, added to Gertrude’s confession of her presence in the billiard-room at the time of the crime, looked strange, to say the least. The prominence of the family assured a strenuous effort to find the murderer, and if we had nothing worse to look forward to, we were sure of a distasteful publicity.  Mr. Jamieson shut his note-book with a snap, and thanked us.  “I have an idea,” he said, apropos of nothing at all, “that at any rate the ghost is laid here. Whatever the rappings have been—and the colored man says they began when the family went west three months ago—they are likely to stop now.”  Which shows how much he knew about it. The ghost was not laid: with the murder of Arnold Armstrong he, or it, only seemed to take on fresh vigor.  Mr. Jamieson left then, and when Gertrude had gone up-stairs, as she did at once, I sat and thought over what I had just heard. Her engagement, once so engrossing a matter, paled now beside the significance of her story. If Halsey and Jack Bailey had left before the crime, how came Halsey’s revolver in the tulip bed? What was the mysterious cause of their sudden flight? What had Gertrude left in the billiard-room? What was the significance of the cuff-link, and where was it?     CHAPTER VI. IN THE EAST CORRIDOR   When the detective left he enjoined absolute secrecy on everybody in the household. The Greenwood Club promised the same thing, and as there are no Sunday afternoon papers, the murder was not publicly known until Monday. The coroner himself notified the Armstrong family lawyer, and early in the afternoon he came out. I had not seen Mr. Jamieson since morning, but I knew he had been interrogating the servants. Gertrude was locked in her room with a headache, and I had luncheon alone.  Mr. Harton, the lawyer, was a little, thin man, and he looked as if he did not relish his business that day.  “This is very unfortunate, Miss Innes,” he said, after we had shaken hands. “Most unfortunate—and mysterious. With the father and mother in the west, I find everything devolves on me; and, as you can understand, it is an unpleasant duty.”  “No doubt,” I said absently. “Mr. Harton, I am going to ask you some questions, and I hope you will answer them. I feel that I am entitled to some knowledge, because I and my family are just now in a most ambiguous position.”  I don’t know whether he understood me or not: he took of his glasses and wiped them.  “I shall be very happy,” he said with old-fashioned courtesy.  “Thank you. Mr. Harton, did Mr. Arnold Armstrong know that Sunnyside had been rented?”  “I think—yes, he did. In fact, I myself told him about it.”  “And he knew who the tenants were?”  “Yes.”  “He had not been living with the family for some years, I believe?”  “No. Unfortunately, there had been trouble between Arnold and his father. For two years he had lived in town.”  “Then it would be unlikely that he came here last night to get possession of anything belonging to him?”  “I should think it hardly possible,” he admitted. “To be perfectly frank, Miss Innes, I can not think of any reason whatever for his coming here as he did. He had been staying at the club-house across the valley for the last week, Jarvis tells me, but that only explains how he came here, not why. It is a most unfortunate family.”  He shook his head despondently, and I felt that this dried-up little man was the repository of much that he had not told me. I gave up trying to elicit any information from him, and we went together to view the body before it was taken to the city. It had been lifted on to the billiard-table and a sheet thrown over it; otherwise nothing had been touched. A soft hat lay beside it, and the collar of the dinner-coat was still turned up. The handsome, dissipated face of Arnold Armstrong, purged of its ugly lines, was now only pathetic. As we went in Mrs. Watson appeared at the card-room door.  “Come in, Mrs. Watson,” the lawyer said. But she shook her head and withdrew: she was the only one in the house who seemed to regret the dead man, and even she seemed rather shocked than sorry.  I went to the door at the foot of the circular staircase and opened it. If I could only have seen Halsey coming at his usual hare-brained clip up the drive, if I could have heard the throb of the motor, I would have felt that my troubles were over.  But there was nothing to be seen. The countryside lay sunny and quiet in its peaceful Sunday afternoon calm, and far down the drive Mr. Jamieson was walking slowly, stooping now and then, as if to examine the road. When I went back, Mr. Harton was furtively wiping his eyes.  “The prodigal has come home, Miss Innes,” he said. “How often the sins of the fathers are visited on the children!” Which left me pondering.  Before Mr. Harton left, he told me something of the Armstrong family. Paul Armstrong, the father, had been married twice. Arnold was a son by the first marriage. The second Mrs. Armstrong had been a widow, with a child, a little girl. This child, now perhaps twenty, was Louise Armstrong, having taken her stepfather’s name, and was at present in California with the family.  “They will probably return at once,” he concluded “sad part of my errand here to-day is to see if you will relinquish your lease here in their favor.”  “We would better wait and see if they wish to come,” I said. “It seems unlikely, and my town house is being remodeled.” At that he let the matter drop, but it came up unpleasantly enough, later.  At six o’clock the body was taken away, and at seven-thirty, after an early dinner, Mr. Harton went. Gertrude had not come down, and there was no news of Halsey. Mr. Jamieson had taken a lodging in the village, and I had not seen him since mid-afternoon. It was about nine o’clock, I think, when the bell rang and he was ushered into the living-room.  “Sit down,” I said grimly. “Have you found a clue that will incriminate me, Mr. Jamieson?”  He had the grace to look uncomfortable. “No,” he said. “If you had killed Mr. Armstrong, you would have left no clues. You would have had too much intelligence.”  After that we got along better. He was fishing in his pocket, and after a minute he brought out two scraps of paper. “I have been to the club-house,” he said, “and among Mr. Armstrong’s effects, I found these. One is curious; the other is puzzling.”  The first was a sheet of club note-paper, on which was written, over and over, the name “Halsey B. Innes.” It was Halsey’s flowing signature to a dot, but it lacked Halsey’s ease. The ones toward the bottom of the sheet were much better than the top ones. Mr. Jamieson smiled at my face.  “His old tricks,” he said. “That one is merely curious; this one, as I said before, is puzzling.”  The second scrap, folded and refolded into a compass so tiny that the writing had been partly obliterated, was part of a letter—the lower half of a sheet, not typed, but written in a cramped hand.  “——by altering the plans for——rooms, may be possible. The best way, in my opinion, would be to——the plan for——in one of the——rooms——chimney.”   That was all.  “Well?” I said, looking up. “There is nothing in that, is there? A man ought to be able to change the plan of his house without becoming an object of suspicion.”  “There is little in the paper itself,” he admitted; “but why should Arnold Armstrong carry that around, unless it meant something? He never built a house, you may be sure of that. If it is this house, it may mean anything, from a secret room—”  “To an extra bath-room,” I said scornfully. “Haven’t you a thumb-print, too?”  “I have,” he said with a smile, “and the print of a foot in a tulip bed, and a number of other things. The oddest part is, Miss Innes, that the thumb-mark is probably yours and the footprint certainly.”  His audacity was the only thing that saved me: his amused smile put me on my mettle, and I ripped out a perfectly good scallop before I answered.  “Why did I step into the tulip bed?” I asked with interest.  “You picked up something,” he said good-humoredly, “which you are going to tell me about later.”  “Am I, indeed?” I was politely curious. “With this remarkable insight of yours, I wish you would tell me where I shall find my four-thousand-dollar motor car.”  “I was just coming to that,” he said. “You will find it about thirty miles away, at Andrews Station, in a blacksmith shop, where it is being repaired.”  I laid down my knitting then and looked at him.  “And Halsey?” I managed to say.  “We are going to exchange information,” he said “I am going to tell you that, when you tell me what you picked up in the tulip bed.”  We looked steadily at each other: it was not an unfriendly stare; we were only measuring weapons. Then he smiled a little and got up.  “With your permission,” he said, “I am going to examine the card-room and the staircase again. You might think over my offer in the meantime.”  He went on through the drawing-room, and I listened to his footsteps growing gradually fainter. I dropped my pretense at knitting and, leaning back, I thought over the last forty-eight hours. Here was I, Rachel Innes, spinster, a granddaughter of old John Innes of Revolutionary days, a D. A. R., a Colonial Dame, mixed up with a vulgar and revolting crime, and even attempting to hoodwink the law! Certainly I had left the straight and narrow way.  I was roused by hearing Mr. Jamieson coming rapidly back through the drawing-room. He stopped at the door.  “Miss Innes,” he said quickly, “will you come with me and light the east corridor? I have fastened somebody in the small room at the head of the card-room stairs.”  I jumped! up at once.  “You mean—the murderer?” I gasped.  “Possibly,” he said quietly, as we hurried together up the stairs. “Some one was lurking on the staircase when I went back. I spoke; instead of an answer, whoever it was turned and ran up. I followed—it was dark—but as I turned the corner at the top a figure darted through this door and closed it. The bolt was on my side, and I pushed it forward. It is a closet, I think.” We were in the upper hall now. “If you will show me the electric switch, Miss Innes, you would better wait in your own room.”  Trembling as I was, I was determined to see that door opened. I hardly knew what I feared, but so many terrible and inexplicable things had happened that suspense was worse than certainty.  “I am perfectly cool,” I said, “and I am going to remain here.”  The lights flashed up along that end of the corridor, throwing the doors into relief. At the intersection of the small hallway with the larger, the circular staircase wound its way up, as if it had been an afterthought of the architect. And just around the corner, in the small corridor, was the door Mr. Jamieson had indicated. I was still unfamiliar with the house, and I did not remember the door. My heart was thumping wildly in my ears, but I nodded to him to go ahead. I was perhaps eight or ten feet away—and then he threw the bolt back.  “Come out,” he said quietly. There was no response. “Come—out,” he repeated. Then—I think he had a revolver, but I am not sure—he stepped aside and threw the door open.  From where I stood I could not see beyond the door, but I saw Mr. Jamieson’s face change and heard him mutter something, then he bolted down the stairs, three at a time. When my knees had stopped shaking, I moved forward, slowly, nervously, until I had a partial view of what was beyond the door. It seemed at first to be a closet, empty. Then I went close and examined it, to stop with a shudder. Where the floor should have been was black void and darkness, from which came the indescribable, damp smell of the cellars.  Mr. Jamieson had locked somebody in the clothes chute. As I leaned over I fancied I heard a groan—or was it the wind?     CHAPTER VII. A SPRAINED ANKLE   I was panic-stricken. As I ran along the corridor I was confident that the mysterious intruder and probable murderer had been found, and that he lay dead or dying at the foot of the chute. I got down the staircase somehow, and through the kitchen to the basement stairs. Mr. Jamieson had been before me, and the door stood open. Liddy was standing in the middle of the kitchen, holding a frying-pan by the handle as a weapon.  “Don’t go down there,” she yelled, when she saw me moving toward the basement stairs. “Don’t you do it, Miss Rachel. That Jamieson’s down there now. There’s only trouble comes of hunting ghosts; they lead you into bottomless pits and things like that. Oh, Miss Rachel, don’t—” as I tried to get past her.  She was interrupted by Mr. Jamieson’s reappearance. He ran up the stairs two at a time, and his face was flushed and furious.  “The whole place is locked,” he said angrily. “Where’s the laundry key kept?”  “It’s kept in the door,” Liddy snapped. “That whole end of the cellar is kept locked, so nobody can get at the clothes, and then the key’s left in the door? so that unless a thief was as blind as—as some detectives, he could walk right in.”  “Liddy,” I said sharply, “come down with us and turn on all the lights.”  She offered her resignation, as usual, on the spot, but I took her by the arm, and she came along finally. She switched on all the lights and pointed to a door just ahead.  “That’s the door,” she said sulkily. “The key’s in it.”  But the key was not in it. Mr. Jamieson shook it, but it was a heavy door, well locked. And then he stooped and began punching around the keyhole with the end of a lead-pencil. When he stood up his face was exultant.  “It’s locked on the inside,” he said in a low tone. “There is somebody in there.”  “Lord have mercy!” gasped Liddy, and turned to run.  “Liddy,” I called, “go through the house at once and see who is missing, or if any one is. We’ll have to clear this thing at once. Mr. Jamieson, if you will watch here I will go to the lodge and find Warner. Thomas would be of no use. Together you may be able to force the door.”  “A good idea,” he assented. “But—there are windows, of course, and there is nothing to prevent whoever is in there from getting out that way.”  “Then lock the door at the top of the basement stairs,” I suggested, “and patrol the house from the outside.”  We agreed to this, and I had a feeling that the mystery of Sunnyside was about to be solved. I ran down the steps and along the drive. Just at the corner I ran full tilt into somebody who seemed to be as much alarmed as I was. It was not until I had recoiled a step or two that I recognized Gertrude, and she me.  “Good gracious, Aunt Ray,” she exclaimed, “what is the matter?”  “There’s somebody locked in the laundry,” I panted. “That is—unless—you didn’t see any one crossing the lawn or skulking around the house, did you?”  “I think we have mystery on the brain,” Gertrude said wearily. “No, I haven’t seen any one, except old Thomas, who looked for all the world as if he had been ransacking the pantry. What have you locked in the laundry?”  “I can’t wait to explain,” I replied. “I must get Warner from the lodge. If you came out for air, you’d better put on your overshoes.” And then I noticed that Gertrude was limping—not much, but sufficiently to make her progress very slow, and seemingly painful.  “You have hurt yourself,” I said sharply.  “I fell over the carriage block,” she explained. “I thought perhaps I might see Halsey coming home. He—he ought to be here.”  I hurried on down the drive. The lodge was some distance from the house, in a grove of trees where the drive met the county road. There were two white stone pillars to mark the entrance, but the iron gates, once closed and tended by the lodge-keeper, now stood permanently open. The day of the motor-car had come; no one had time for closed gates and lodge-keepers. The lodge at Sunnyside was merely a sort of supplementary servants’ quarters: it was as convenient in its appointments as the big house and infinitely more cozy.  As I went down the drive, my thoughts were busy. Who would it be that Mr. Jamieson had trapped in the cellar? Would we find a body or some one badly injured? Scarcely either. Whoever had fallen had been able to lock the laundry door on the inside. If the fugitive had come from outside the house, how did he get in? If it was some member of the household, who could it have been? And then—a feeling of horror almost overwhelmed me. Gertrude! Gertrude and her injured ankle! Gertrude found limping slowly up the drive when I had thought she was in bed!  I tried to put the thought away, but it would not go. If Gertrude had been on the circular staircase that night, why had she fled from Mr. Jamieson? The idea, puzzling as it was, seemed borne out by this circumstance. Whoever had taken refuge at the head of the stairs could scarcely have been familiar with the house, or with the location of the chute. The mystery seemed to deepen constantly. What possible connection could there be between Halsey and Gertrude, and the murder of Arnold Armstrong? And yet, every way I turned I seemed to find something that pointed to such a connection.  At the foot of the drive the road described a long, sloping, horseshoe-shaped curve around the lodge. There were lights there, streaming cheerfully out on to the trees, and from an upper room came wavering shadows, as if some one with a lamp was moving around. I had come almost silently in my evening slippers, and I had my second collision of the evening on the road just above the house. I ran full into a man in a long coat, who was standing in the shadow beside the drive, with his back to me, watching the lighted windows.  “What the hell!” he ejaculated furiously, and turned around. When he saw me, however, he did not wait for any retort on my part. He faded away—this is not slang; he did—he absolutely disappeared in the dusk without my getting more than a glimpse of his face. I had a vague impression of unfamiliar features and of a sort of cap with a visor. Then he was gone.  I went to the lodge and rapped. It required two or three poundings to bring Thomas to the door, and he opened it only an inch or so.  “Where is Warner?” I asked.  “I—I think he’s in bed, ma’m.”  “Get him up,” I said, “and for goodness’ sake open the door, Thomas. I’ll wait for Warner.”  “It’s kind o’ close in here, ma’m,” he said, obeying gingerly, and disclosing a cool and comfortable looking interior. “Perhaps you’d keer to set on the porch an’ rest yo’self.”  It was so evident that Thomas did not want me inside that I went in.  “Tell Warner he is needed in a hurry,” I repeated, and turned into the little sitting-room. I could hear Thomas going up the stairs, could hear him rouse Warner, and the steps of the chauffeur as he hurriedly dressed. But my attention was busy with the room below.  On the center-table, open, was a sealskin traveling bag. It was filled with gold-topped bottles and brushes, and it breathed opulence, luxury, femininity from every inch of surface. How did it get there? I was still asking myself the question when Warner came running down the stairs and into the room. He was completely but somewhat incongruously dressed, and his open, boyish face looked abashed. He was a country boy, absolutely frank and reliable, of fair education and intelligence—one of the small army of American youths who turn a natural aptitude for mechanics into the special field of the automobile, and earn good salaries in a congenial occupation.  “What is it, Miss Innes?” he asked anxiously.  “There is some one locked in the laundry,” I replied. “Mr. Jamieson wants you to help him break the lock. Warner, whose bag is this?”  He was in the doorway by this time, and he pretended not to hear.  “Warner,” I called, “come back here. Whose bag is this?”  He stopped then, but he did not turn around.  “It’s—it belongs to Thomas,” he said, and fled up the drive.  To Thomas! A London bag with mirrors and cosmetic jars of which Thomas could not even have guessed the use! However, I put the bag in the back of my mind, which was fast becoming stored with anomalous and apparently irreconcilable facts, and followed Warner to the house.  Liddy had come back to the kitchen: the door to the basement stairs was double-barred, and had a table pushed against it; and beside her on the table was most of the kitchen paraphernalia.  “Did you see if there was any one missing in the house?” I asked, ignoring the array of sauce-pans rolling-pins, and the poker of the range.  “Rosie is missing,” Liddy said with unction. She had objected to Rosie, the parlor maid, from the start. “Mrs. Watson went into her room, and found she had gone without her hat. People that trust themselves a dozen miles from the city, in strange houses, with servants they don’t know, needn’t be surprised if they wake up some morning and find their throats cut.”  After which carefully veiled sarcasm Liddy relapsed into gloom. Warner came in then with a handful of small tools, and Mr. Jamieson went with him to the basement. Oddly enough, I was not alarmed. With all my heart I wished for Halsey, but I was not frightened. At the door he was to force, Warner put down his tools and looked at it. Then he turned the handle. Without the slightest difficulty the door opened, revealing the blackness of the drying-room beyond!  Mr. Jamieson gave an exclamation of disgust.  “Gone!” he said. “Confound such careless work! I might have known.”  It was true enough. We got the lights on finally and looked all through the three rooms that constituted this wing of the basement. Everything was quiet and empty. An explanation of how the fugitive had escaped injury was found in a heaped-up basket of clothes under the chute. The basket had been overturned, but that was all. Mr. Jamieson examined the windows: one was unlocked, and offered an easy escape. The window or the door? Which way had the fugitive escaped? The door seemed most probable, and I hoped it had been so. I could not have borne, just then, to think that it was my poor Gertrude we had been hounding through the darkness, and yet—I had met Gertrude not far from that very window.  I went up-stairs at last, tired and depressed. Mrs. Watson and Liddy were making tea in the kitchen. In certain walks of life the tea-pot is the refuge in times of stress, trouble or sickness: they give tea to the dying and they put it in the baby’s nursing bottle. Mrs. Watson was fixing a tray to be sent in to me, and when I asked her about Rosie she confirmed her absence.  “She’s not here,” she said; “but I would not think much of that, Miss Innes. Rosie is a pretty young girl, and perhaps she has a sweetheart. It will be a good thing if she has. The maids stay much better when they have something like that to hold them here.”  Gertrude had gone back to her room, and while I was drinking my cup of hot tea, Mr. Jamieson came in.  “We might take up the conversation where we left off an hour and a half ago,” he said. “But before we go on, I want to say this: The person who escaped from the laundry was a woman with a foot of moderate size and well arched. She wore nothing but a stocking on her right foot, and, in spite of the unlocked door, she escaped by the window.”  And again I thought of Gertrude’s sprained ankle. Was it the right or the left?     CHAPTER VIII. THE OTHER HALF OF THE LINE   “Miss Innes,” the detective began, “what is your opinion of the figure you saw on the east veranda the night you and your maid were in the house alone?”  “It was a woman,” I said positively.  “And yet your maid affirms with equal positiveness that it was a man.”  “Nonsense,” I broke in. “Liddy had her eyes shut—she always shuts them when she’s frightened.”  “And you never thought then that the intruder who came later that night might be a woman—the woman, in fact, whom you saw on the veranda?”  “I had reasons for thinking it was a man,” I said, remembering the pearl cuff-link.  “Now we are getting down to business. WHAT were your reasons for thinking that?”  I hesitated.  “If you have any reason for believing that your midnight guest was Mr. Armstrong, other than his visit here the next night, you ought to tell me, Miss Innes. We can take nothing for granted. If, for instance, the intruder who dropped the bar and scratched the staircase—you see, I know about that—if this visitor was a woman, why should not the same woman have come back the following night, met Mr. Armstrong on the circular staircase, and in alarm shot him?”  “It was a man,” I reiterated. And then, because I could think of no other reason for my statement, I told him about the pearl cuff-link. He was intensely interested.  “Will you give me the link,” he said, when I finished, “or, at least, let me see it? I consider it a most important clue.”  “Won’t the description do?”  “Not as well as the original.”  “Well, I’m very sorry,” I said, as calmly as I could, “I—the thing is lost. It—it must have fallen out of a box on my dressing-table.”  Whatever he thought of my explanation, and I knew he doubted it, he made no sign. He asked me to describe the link accurately, and I did so, while he glanced at a list he took from his pocket.  “One set monogram cuff-links,” he read, “one set plain pearl links, one set cuff-links, woman’s head set with diamonds and emeralds. There is no mention of such a link as you describe, and yet, if your theory is right, Mr. Armstrong must have taken back in his cuffs one complete cuff-link, and a half, perhaps, of the other.”  The idea was new to me. If it had not been the murdered man who had entered the house that night, who had it been?  “There are a number of strange things connected with this case,” the detective went on. “Miss Gertrude Innes testified that she heard some one fumbling with the lock, that the door opened, and that almost immediately the shot was fired. Now, Miss Innes, here is the strange part of that. Mr. Armstrong had no key with him. There was no key in the lock, or on the floor. In other words, the evidence points absolutely to this: Mr. Armstrong was admitted to the house from within.”  “It is impossible,” I broke in. “Mr. Jamieson, do you know what your words imply? Do you know that you are practically accusing Gertrude Innes of admitting that man?”  “Not quite that,” he said, with his friendly smile. “In fact, Miss Innes, I am quite certain she did not. But as long as I learn only parts of the truth, from both you and her, what can I do? I know you picked up something in the flower bed: you refuse to tell me what it was. I know Miss Gertrude went back to the billiard-room to get something, she refuses to say what. You suspect what happened to the cuff-link, but you won’t tell me. So far, all I am sure of is this: I do not believe Arnold Armstrong was the midnight visitor who so alarmed you by dropping—shall we say, a golf-stick? And I believe that when he did come he was admitted by some one in the house. Who knows—it may have been—Liddy!”  I stirred my tea angrily.  “I have always heard,” I said dryly, “that undertakers’ assistants are jovial young men. A man’s sense of humor seems to be in inverse proportion to the gravity of his profession.”  “A man’s sense of humor is a barbarous and a cruel thing, Miss Innes,” he admitted. “It is to the feminine as the hug of a bear is to the scratch of—well;—anything with claws. Is that you, Thomas? Come in.”  Thomas Johnson stood in the doorway. He looked alarmed and apprehensive, and suddenly I remembered the sealskin dressing-bag in the lodge. Thomas came just inside the door and stood with his head drooping, his eyes, under their shaggy gray brows, fixed on Mr. Jamieson.  “Thomas,” said the detective, not unkindly, “I sent for you to tell us what you told Sam Bohannon at the club, the day before Mr. Arnold was found here, dead. Let me see. You came here Friday night to see Miss Innes, didn’t you? And came to work here Saturday morning?”  For some unexplained reason Thomas looked relieved.  “Yas, sah,” he said. “You see it were like this: When Mistah Armstrong and the fam’ly went away, Mis’ Watson an’ me, we was lef’ in charge till the place was rented. Mis’ Watson, she’ve bin here a good while, an’ she warn’ skeery. So she slep’ in the house. I’d bin havin’ tokens—I tol’ Mis’ Innes some of ’em—an’ I slep’ in the lodge. Then one day Mis’ Watson, she came to me an’ she sez, sez she, ‘Thomas, you’ll hev to sleep up in the big house. I’m too nervous to do it any more.’ But I jes’ reckon to myself that ef it’s too skeery fer her, it’s too skeery fer me. We had it, then, sho’ nuff, and it ended up with Mis’ Watson stayin’ in the lodge nights an’ me lookin’ fer work at de club.”  “Did Mrs. Watson say that anything had happened to alarm her?”  “No, sah. She was jes’ natchally skeered. Well, that was all, far’s I know, until the night I come over to see Mis’ Innes. I come across the valley, along the path from the club-house, and I goes home that way. Down in the creek bottom I almost run into a man. He wuz standin’ with his back to me, an’ he was workin’ with one of these yere electric light things that fit in yer pocket. He was havin’ trouble—one minute it’d flash out, an’ the nex’ it’d be gone. I hed a view of ’is white dress shirt an’ tie, as I passed. I didn’t see his face. But I know it warn’t Mr. Arnold. It was a taller man than Mr. Arnold. Beside that, Mr. Arnold was playin’ cards when I got to the club-house, same’s he’d been doin’ all day.”  “And the next morning you came back along the path,” pursued Mr. Jamieson relentlessly.  “The nex’ mornin’ I come back along the path an’ down where I dun see the man night befoh, I picked up this here.” The old man held out a tiny object and Mr. Jamieson took it. Then he held it on his extended palm for me to see. It was the other half of the pearl cuff-link!  But Mr. Jamieson was not quite through questioning him.  “And so you showed it to Sam, at the club, and asked him if he knew any one who owned such a link, and Sam said—what?”  “Wal, Sam, he ’lowed he’d seen such a pair of cuff-buttons in a shirt belongin’ to Mr. Bailey—Mr. Jack Bailey, sah.”  “I’ll keep this link, Thomas, for a while,” the detective said. “That’s all I wanted to know. Good night.”  As Thomas shuffled out, Mr. Jamieson watched me sharply.  “You see, Miss Innes,” he said, “Mr. Bailey insists on mixing himself with this thing. If Mr. Bailey came here that Friday night expecting to meet Arnold Armstrong, and missed him—if, as I say, he had done this, might he not, seeing him enter the following night, have struck him down, as he had intended before?”  “But the motive?” I gasped.  “There could be motive proved, I think. Arnold Armstrong and John Bailey have been enemies since the latter, as cashier of the Traders’ Bank, brought Arnold almost into the clutches of the law. Also, you forget that both men have been paying attention to Miss Gertrude. Bailey’s flight looks bad, too.”  “And you think Halsey helped him to escape?”  “Undoubtedly. Why, what could it be but flight? Miss Innes, let me reconstruct that evening, as I see it. Bailey and Armstrong had quarreled at the club. I learned this to-day. Your nephew brought Bailey over. Prompted by jealous, insane fury, Armstrong followed, coming across by the path. He entered the billiard-room wing—perhaps rapping, and being admitted by your nephew. Just inside he was shot, by some one on the circular staircase. The shot fired, your nephew and Bailey left the house at once, going toward the automobile house. They left by the lower road, which prevented them being heard, and when you and Miss Gertrude got down-stairs everything was quiet.”  “But—Gertrude’s story,” I stammered.  “Miss Gertrude only brought forward her explanation the following morning. I do not believe it, Miss Innes. It is the story of a loving and ingenious woman.”  “And—this thing to-night?”  “May upset my whole view of the case. We must give the benefit of every doubt, after all. We may, for instance, come back to the figure on the porch: if it was a woman you saw that night through the window, we might start with other premises. Or Mr. Innes’ explanation may turn us in a new direction. It is possible that he shot Arnold Armstrong as a burglar and then fled, frightened at what he had done. In any case, however, I feel confident that the body was here when he left. Mr. Armstrong left the club ostensibly for a moonlight saunter, about half after eleven o’clock. It was three when the shot was fired.”  I leaned back bewildered. It seemed to me that the evening had been full of significant happenings, had I only held the key. Had Gertrude been the fugitive in the clothes chute? Who was the man on the drive near the lodge, and whose gold-mounted dressing-bag had I seen in the lodge sitting-room?  It was late when Mr. Jamieson finally got up to go. I went with him to the door, and together we stood looking out over the valley. Below lay the village of Casanova, with its Old World houses, its blossoming trees and its peace. Above on the hill across the valley were the lights of the Greenwood Club. It was even possible to see the curving row of parallel lights that marked the carriage road. Rumors that I had heard about the club came back—of drinking, of high play, and once, a year ago, of a suicide under those very lights.  Mr. Jamieson left, taking a short cut to the village, and I still stood there. It must have been after eleven, and the monotonous tick of the big clock on the stairs behind me was the only sound.  Then I was conscious that some one was running up the drive. In a minute a woman darted into the area of light made by the open door, and caught me by the arm. It was Rosie—Rosie in a state of collapse from terror, and, not the least important, clutching one of my Coalport plates and a silver spoon.  She stood staring into the darkness behind, still holding the plate. I got her into the house and secured the plate; then I stood and looked down at her where she crouched tremblingly against the doorway.  “Well,” I asked, “didn’t your young man enjoy his meal?”  She couldn’t speak. She looked at the spoon she still held—I wasn’t so anxious about it: thank Heaven, it wouldn’t chip—and then she stared at me.  “I appreciate your desire to have everything nice for him,” I went on, “but the next time, you might take the Limoges china It’s more easily duplicated and less expensive.”  “I haven’t a young man—not here.” She had got her breath now, as I had guessed she would. “I—I have been chased by a thief, Miss Innes.”  “Did he chase you out of the house and back again?” I asked.  Then Rosie began to cry—not silently, but noisily, hysterically.  I stopped her by giving her a good shake.  “What in the world is the matter with you?” I snapped. “Has the day of good common sense gone by! Sit up and tell me the whole thing.” Rosie sat up then, and sniffled.  “I was coming up the drive—” she began.  “You must start with when you went DOWN the drive, with my dishes and my silver,” I interrupted, but, seeing more signs of hysteria, I gave in. “Very well. You were coming up the drive—”  “I had a basket of—of silver and dishes on my arm and I was carrying the plate, because—because I was afraid I’d break it. Part-way up the road a man stepped out of the bushes, and held his arm like this, spread out, so I couldn’t get past. He said—he said—‘Not so fast, young lady; I want you to let me see what’s in that basket.’”  She got up in her excitement and took hold of my arm.  “It was like this, Miss Innes,” she said, “and say you was the man. When he said that, I screamed and ducked under his arm like this. He caught at the basket and I dropped it. I ran as fast as I could, and he came after as far as the trees. Then he stopped. Oh, Miss Innes, it must have been the man that killed that Mr. Armstrong!”  “Don’t be foolish,” I said. “Whoever killed Mr. Armstrong would put as much space between himself and this house as he could. Go up to bed now; and mind, if I hear of this story being repeated to the other maids, I shall deduct from your wages for every broken dish I find in the drive.”  I listened to Rosie as she went up-stairs, running past the shadowy places and slamming her door. Then I sat down and looked at the Coalport plate and the silver spoon. I had brought my own china and silver, and, from all appearances, I would have little enough to take back. But though I might jeer at Rosie as much as I wished, the fact remained that some one had been on the drive that night who had no business there. Although neither had Rosie, for that matter.  I could fancy Liddy’s face when she missed the extra pieces of china—she had opposed Rosie from the start. If Liddy once finds a prophecy fulfilled, especially an unpleasant one, she never allows me to forget it. It seemed to me that it was absurd to leave that china dotted along the road for her to spy the next morning; so with a sudden resolution, I opened the door again and stepped out into the darkness. As the door closed behind me I half regretted my impulse; then I shut my teeth and went on.  I have never been a nervous woman, as I said before. Moreover, a minute or two in the darkness enabled me to see things fairly well. Beulah gave me rather a start by rubbing unexpectedly against my feet; then we two, side by side, went down the drive.  There were no fragments of china, but where the grove began I picked up a silver spoon. So far Rosie’s story was borne out: I began to wonder if it were not indiscreet, to say the least, this midnight prowling in a neighborhood with such a deservedly bad reputation. Then I saw something gleaming, which proved to be the handle of a cup, and a step or two farther on I found a V-shaped bit of a plate. But the most surprising thing of all was to find the basket sitting comfortably beside the road, with the rest of the broken crockery piled neatly within, and a handful of small silver, spoon, forks, and the like, on top! I could only stand and stare. Then Rosie’s story was true. But where had Rosie carried her basket? And why had the thief, if he were a thief, picked up the broken china out of the road and left it, with his booty?  It was with my nearest approach to a nervous collapse that I heard the familiar throbbing of an automobile engine. As it came closer I recognized the outline of the Dragon Fly, and knew that Halsey had come back.  Strange enough it must have seemed to Halsey, too, to come across me in the middle of the night, with the skirt of my gray silk gown over my shoulders to keep off the dew, holding a red and green basket under one arm and a black cat under the other. What with relief and joy, I began to cry, right there, and very nearly wiped my eyes on Beulah in the excitement.     CHAPTER IX. JUST LIKE A GIRL   “Aunt Ray!” Halsey said from the gloom behind the lamps. “What in the world are you doing here?”  “Taking a walk,” I said, trying to be composed. I don’t think the answer struck either of us as being ridiculous at the time. “Oh, Halsey, where have you been?”  “Let me take you up to the house.” He was in the road, and had Beulah and the basket out of my arms in a moment. I could see the car plainly now, and Warner was at the wheel—Warner in an ulster and a pair of slippers, over Heaven knows what. Jack Bailey was not there. I got in, and we went slowly and painfully up to the house.  We did not talk. What we had to say was too important to commence there, and, besides, it took all kinds of coaxing from both men to get the Dragon Fly up the last grade. Only when we had closed the front door and stood facing each other in the hall, did Halsey say anything. He slipped his strong young arm around my shoulders and turned me so I faced the light.  “Poor Aunt Ray!” he said gently. And I nearly wept again. “I—I must see Gertrude, too; we will have a three-cornered talk.”  And then Gertrude herself came down the stairs. She had not been to bed, evidently: she still wore the white negligée she had worn earlier in the evening, and she limped somewhat. During her slow progress down the stairs I had time to notice one thing: Mr. Jamieson had said the woman who escaped from the cellar had worn no shoe on her right foot. Gertrude’s right ankle was the one she had sprained!  The meeting between brother and sister was tense, but without tears. Halsey kissed her tenderly, and I noticed evidences of strain and anxiety in both young faces.  “Is everything—right?” she asked.  “Right as can be,” with forced cheerfulness.  I lighted the living-room and we went in there. Only a half-hour before I had sat with Mr. Jamieson in that very room, listening while he overtly accused both Gertrude and Halsey of at least a knowledge of the death of Arnold Armstrong. Now Halsey was here to speak for himself: I should learn everything that had puzzled me.  “I saw it in the paper to-night for the first time,” he was saying. “It knocked me dumb. When I think of this houseful of women, and a thing like that occurring!”  Gertrude’s face was still set and white. “That isn’t all, Halsey,” she said. “You and—and Jack left almost at the time it happened. The detective here thinks that you—that we—know something about it.”  “The devil he does!” Halsey’s eyes were fairly starting from his head. “I beg your pardon, Aunt Ray, but—the fellow’s a lunatic.”  “Tell me everything, won’t you, Halsey?” I begged. “Tell me where you went that night, or rather morning, and why you went as you did. This has been a terrible forty-eight hours for all of us.”  He stood staring at me, and I could see the horror of the situation dawning in his face.  “I can’t tell you where I went, Aunt Ray,” he said, after a moment. “As to why, you will learn that soon enough. But Gertrude knows that Jack and I left the house before this thing—this horrible murder—occurred.”  “Mr. Jamieson does not believe me,” Gertrude said drearily. “Halsey, if the worst comes, if they should arrest you, you must—tell.”  “I shall tell nothing,” he said with a new sternness in his voice. “Aunt Ray, it was necessary for Jack and me to leave that night. I can not tell you why—just yet. As to where we went, if I have to depend on that as an alibi, I shall not tell. The whole thing is an absurdity, a trumped-up charge that can not possibly be serious.”  “Has Mr. Bailey gone back to the city,” I demanded, “or to the club?”  “Neither,” defiantly; “at the present moment I do not know where he is.”  “Halsey,” I asked gravely, leaning forward, “have you the slightest suspicion who killed Arnold Armstrong? The police think he was admitted from within, and that he was shot down from above, by someone on the circular staircase.”  “I know nothing of it,” he maintained; but I fancied I caught a sudden glance at Gertrude, a flash of something that died as it came.  As quietly, as calmly as I could, I went over the whole story, from the night Liddy and I had been alone up to the strange experience of Rosie and her pursuer. The basket still stood on the table, a mute witness to this last mystifying occurrence.  “There is something else,” I said hesitatingly, at the last. “Halsey, I have never told this even to Gertrude, but the morning after the crime, I found, in a tulip bed, a revolver. It—it was yours, Halsey.”  For an appreciable moment Halsey stared at me. Then he turned to Gertrude.  “My revolver, Trude!” he exclaimed. “Why, Jack took my revolver with him, didn’t he?”  “Oh, for Heaven’s sake don’t say that,” I implored. “The detective thinks possibly Jack Bailey came back, and—and the thing happened then.”  “He didn’t come back,” Halsey said sternly. “Gertrude, when you brought down a revolver that night for Jack to take with him, what one did you bring? Mine?”  Gertrude was defiant now.  “No. Yours was loaded, and I was afraid of what Jack might do. I gave him one I have had for a year or two. It was empty.”  Halsey threw up both hands despairingly.  “If that isn’t like a girl!” he said. “Why didn’t you do what I asked you to, Gertrude? You send Bailey off with an empty gun, and throw mine in a tulip bed, of all places on earth! Mine was a thirty-eight caliber. The inquest will show, of course, that the bullet that killed Armstrong was a thirty-eight. Then where shall I be?”  “You forget,” I broke in, “that I have the revolver, and that no one knows about it.”  But Gertrude had risen angrily.  “I can not stand it; it is always with me,” she cried. “Halsey, I did not throw your revolver into the tulip bed. I—think—you—did it—yourself!”  They stared at each other across the big library table, with young eyes all at once hard, suspicious. And then Gertrude held out both hands to him appealingly.  “We must not,” she said brokenly. “Just now, with so much at stake, it—is shameful. I know you are as ignorant as I am. Make me believe it, Halsey.”  Halsey soothed her as best he could, and the breach seemed healed. But long after I went to bed he sat down-stairs in the living-room alone, and I knew he was going over the case as he had learned it. Some things were clear to him that were dark to me. He knew, and Gertrude, too, why Jack Bailey and he had gone away that night, as they did. He knew where they had been for the last forty-eight hours, and why Jack Bailey had not returned with him. It seemed to me that without fuller confidence from both the children—they are always children to me—I should never be able to learn anything.  As I was finally getting ready for bed, Halsey came up-stairs and knocked at my door. When I had got into a negligée—I used to say wrapper before Gertrude came back from school—I let him in. He stood in the doorway a moment, and then he went into agonies of silent mirth. I sat down on the side of the bed and waited in severe silence for him to stop, but he only seemed to grow worse.  When he had recovered he took me by the elbow and pulled me in front of the mirror.  “‘How to be beautiful,’” he quoted. “‘Advice to maids and matrons,’ by Beatrice Fairfax!” And then I saw myself. I had neglected to remove my wrinkle eradicators, and I presume my appearance was odd. I believe that it is a woman’s duty to care for her looks, but it is much like telling a necessary falsehood—one must not be found out. By the time I got them off Halsey was serious again, and I listened to his story.  “Aunt Ray,” he began, extinguishing his cigarette on the back of my ivory hair-brush, “I would give a lot to tell you the whole thing. But—I can’t, for a day or so, anyhow. But one thing I might have told you a long time ago. If you had known it, you would not have suspected me for a moment of—of having anything to do with the attack on Arnold Armstrong. Goodness knows what I might do to a fellow like that, if there was enough provocation, and I had a gun in my hand—under ordinary circumstances. But—I care a great deal about Louise Armstrong, Aunt Ray. I hope to marry her some day. Is it likely I would kill her brother?”  “Her stepbrother,” I corrected. “No, of course, it isn’t likely, or possible. Why didn’t you tell me, Halsey?”  “Well, there were two reasons,” he said slowly. “One was that you had a girl already picked out for me—”  “Nonsense,” I broke in, and felt myself growing red. I had, indeed, one of the—but no matter.  “And the second reason,” he pursued, “was that the Armstrongs would have none of me.”  I sat bolt upright at that and gasped.  “The Armstrongs!” I repeated. “With old Peter Armstrong driving a stage across the mountains while your grandfather was war governor—”  “Well, of course, the war governor’s dead, and out of the matrimonial market,” Halsey interrupted. “And the present Innes admits himself he isn’t good enough for—for Louise.”  “Exactly,” I said despairingly, “and, of course, you are taken at your own valuation. The Inneses are not always so self-depreciatory.”  “Not always, no,” he said, looking at me with his boyish smile. “Fortunately, Louise doesn’t agree with her family. She’s willing to take me, war governor or no, provided her mother consents. She isn’t overly-fond of her stepfather, but she adores her mother. And now, can’t you see where this thing puts me? Down and out, with all of them.”  “But the whole thing is absurd,” I argued. “And besides, Gertrude’s sworn statement that you left before Arnold Armstrong came would clear you at once.”  Halsey got up and began to pace the room, and the air of cheerfulness dropped like a mask.  “She can’t swear it,” he said finally. “Gertrude’s story was true as far as it went, but she didn’t tell everything. Arnold Armstrong came here at two-thirty—came into the billiard-room and left in five minutes. He came to bring—something.”  “Halsey,” I cried, “you _must_ tell me the whole truth. Every time I see a way for you to escape you block it yourself with this wall of mystery. What did he bring?”  “A telegram—for Bailey,” he said. “It came by special messenger from town, and was—most important. Bailey had started for here, and the messenger had gone back to the city. The steward gave it to Arnold, who had been drinking all day and couldn’t sleep, and was going for a stroll in the direction of Sunnyside.”  “And he brought it?”  “Yes.”  “What was in the telegram?”  “I can tell you—as soon as certain things are made public. It is only a matter of days now,” gloomily.  “And Gertrude’s story of a telephone message?”  “Poor Trude!” he half whispered. “Poor loyal little girl! Aunt Ray, there was no such message. No doubt your detective already knows that and discredits all Gertrude told him.”  “And when she went back, it was to get—the telegram?”  “Probably,” Halsey said slowly. “When you get to thinking about it, Aunt Ray, it looks bad for all three of us, doesn’t it? And yet—I will take my oath none of us even inadvertently killed that poor devil.”  I looked at the closed door into Gertrude’s dressing-room, and lowered my voice.  “The same horrible thought keeps recurring to me,” I whispered. “Halsey, Gertrude probably had your revolver: she must have examined it, anyhow, that night. After you—and Jack had gone, what if that ruffian came back, and she—and she—”  I couldn’t finish. Halsey stood looking at me with shut lips.  “She might have heard him fumbling at the door he had no key, the police say—and thinking it was you, or Jack, she admitted him. When she saw her mistake she ran up the stairs, a step or two, and turning, like an animal at bay, she fired.”  Halsey had his hand over my lips before I finished, and in that position we stared each at the other, our stricken glances crossing.  “The revolver—my revolver—thrown into the tulip bed!” he muttered to himself. “Thrown perhaps from an upper window: you say it was buried deep. Her prostration ever since, her—Aunt Ray, you don’t think it was Gertrude who fell down the clothes chute?”  I could only nod my head in a hopeless affirmative.     CHAPTER X. THE TRADERS’ BANK   The morning after Halsey’s return was Tuesday. Arnold Armstrong had been found dead at the foot of the circular staircase at three o’clock on Sunday morning. The funeral services were to be held on Tuesday, and the interment of the body was to be deferred until the Armstrongs arrived from California. No one, I think, was very sorry that Arnold Armstrong was dead, but the manner of his death aroused some sympathy and an enormous amount of curiosity. Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, a cousin, took charge of the arrangements, and everything, I believe, was as quiet as possible. I gave Thomas Johnson and Mrs. Watson permission to go into town to pay their last respects to the dead man, but for some reason they did not care to go.  Halsey spent part of the day with Mr. Jamieson, but he said nothing of what happened. He looked grave and anxious, and he had a long conversation with Gertrude late in the afternoon.  Tuesday evening found us quiet, with the quiet that precedes an explosion. Gertrude and Halsey were both gloomy and distraught, and as Liddy had already discovered that some of the china was broken—it is impossible to have any secrets from an old servant—I was not in a pleasant humor myself. Warner brought up the afternoon mail and the evening papers at seven—I was curious to know what the papers said of the murder. We had turned away at least a dozen reporters. But I read over the head-line that ran half-way across the top of the _Gazette_ twice before I comprehended it. Halsey had opened the _Chronicle_ and was staring at it fixedly.  “The Traders’ Bank closes its doors!” was what I read, and then I put down the paper and looked across the table.  “Did you know of this?” I asked Halsey.  “I expected it. But not so soon,” he replied.  “And you?” to Gertrude.  “Jack—told us—something,” Gertrude said faintly. “Oh, Halsey, what can he do now?”  “Jack!” I said scornfully. “Your Jack’s flight is easy enough to explain now. And you helped him, both of you, to get away! You get that from your mother; it isn’t an Innes trait. Do you know that every dollar you have, both of you, is in that bank?”  Gertrude tried to speak, but Halsey stopped her.  “That isn’t all, Gertrude,” he said quietly; “Jack is—under arrest.”  “Under arrest!” Gertrude screamed, and tore the paper out of his hand. She glanced at the heading, then she crumpled the newspaper into a ball and flung it to the floor. While Halsey, looking stricken and white, was trying to smooth it out and read it, Gertrude had dropped her head on the table and was sobbing stormily.  I have the clipping somewhere, but just now I can remember only the essentials.  On the afternoon before, Monday, while the Traders’ Bank was in the rush of closing hour, between two and three, Mr. Jacob Trautman, President of the Pearl Brewing Company, came into the bank to lift a loan. As security for the loan he had deposited some three hundred International Steamship Company 5’s, in total value three hundred thousand dollars. Mr. Trautman went to the loan clerk and, after certain formalities had been gone through, the loan clerk went to the vault. Mr. Trautman, who was a large and genial German, waited for a time, whistling under his breath. The loan clerk did not come back. After an interval, Mr. Trautman saw the loan clerk emerge from the vault and go to the assistant cashier: the two went hurriedly to the vault. A lapse of another ten minutes, and the assistant cashier came out and approached Mr. Trautman. He was noticeably white and trembling. Mr. Trautman was told that through an oversight the bonds had been misplaced, and was asked to return the following morning, when everything would be made all right.  Mr. Trautman, however, was a shrewd business man, and he did not like the appearance of things. He left the bank apparently satisfied, and within thirty minutes he had called up three different members of the Traders’ Board of Directors. At three-thirty there was a hastily convened board meeting, with some stormy scenes, and late in the afternoon a national bank examiner was in possession of the books. The bank had not opened for business on Tuesday.  At twelve-thirty o’clock the Saturday before, as soon as the business of the day was closed, Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the defunct bank, had taken his hat and departed. During the afternoon he had called up Mr. Aronson, a member of the board, and said he was ill, and might not be at the bank for a day or two. As Bailey was highly thought of, Mr. Aronson merely expressed a regret. From that time until Monday night, when Mr. Bailey had surrendered to the police, little was known of his movements. Some time after one on Saturday he had entered the Western Union office at Cherry and White Streets and had sent two telegrams. He was at the Greenwood Country Club on Saturday night, and appeared unlike himself. It was reported that he would be released under enormous bond, some time that day, Tuesday.  The article closed by saying that while the officers of the bank refused to talk until the examiner had finished his work, it was known that securities aggregating a million and a quarter were missing. Then there was a diatribe on the possibility of such an occurrence; on the folly of a one-man bank, and of a Board of Directors that met only to lunch together and to listen to a brief report from the cashier, and on the poor policy of a government that arranges a three or four-day examination twice a year. The mystery, it insinuated, had not been cleared by the arrest of the cashier. Before now minor officials had been used to cloak the misdeeds of men higher up. Inseparable as the words “speculation” and “peculation” have grown to be, John Bailey was not known to be in the stock market. His only words, after his surrender, had been “Send for Mr. Armstrong at once.” The telegraph message which had finally reached the President of the Traders’ Bank, in an interior town in California, had been responded to by a telegram from Doctor Walker, the young physician who was traveling with the Armstrong family, saying that Paul Armstrong was very ill and unable to travel.  That was how things stood that Tuesday evening. The Traders’ Bank had suspended payment, and John Bailey was under arrest, charged with wrecking it; Paul Armstrong lay very ill in California, and his only son had been murdered two days before. I sat dazed and bewildered. The children’s money was gone: that was bad enough, though I had plenty, if they would let me share. But Gertrude’s grief was beyond any power of mine to comfort; the man she had chosen stood accused of a colossal embezzlement—and even worse. For in the instant that I sat there I seemed to see the coils closing around John Bailey as the murderer of Arnold Armstrong.  Gertrude lifted her head at last and stared across the table at Halsey.  “Why did he do it?” she wailed. “Couldn’t you stop him, Halsey? It was suicidal to go back!”  Halsey was looking steadily through the windows of the breakfast-room, but it was evident he saw nothing.  “It was the only thing he could do, Trude,” he said at last. “Aunt Ray, when I found Jack at the Greenwood Club last Saturday night, he was frantic. I can not talk until Jack tells me I may, but—he is absolutely innocent of all this, believe me. I thought, Trude and I thought, we were helping him, but it was the wrong way. He came back. Isn’t that the act of an innocent man?”  “Then why did he leave at all?” I asked, unconvinced. “What innocent man would run away from here at three o’clock in the morning? Doesn’t it look rather as though he thought it impossible to escape?”  Gertrude rose angrily. “You are not even just!” she flamed. “You don’t know anything about it, and you condemn him!”  “I know that we have all lost a great deal of money,” I said. “I shall believe Mr. Bailey innocent the moment he is shown to be. You profess to know the truth, but you can not tell me! What am I to think?”  Halsey leaned over and patted my hand.  “You must take us on faith,” he said. “Jack Bailey hasn’t a penny that doesn’t belong to him; the guilty man will be known in a day or so.”  “I shall believe that when it is proved,” I said grimly. “In the meantime, I take no one on faith. The Inneses never do.”  Gertrude, who had been standing aloof at a window, turned suddenly. “But when the bonds are offered for sale, Halsey, won’t the thief be detected at once?”  Halsey turned with a superior smile.  “It wouldn’t be done that way,” he said. “They would be taken out of the vault by some one who had access to it, and used as collateral for a loan in another bank. It would be possible to realize eighty per cent. of their face value.”  “In cash?”  “In cash.”  “But the man who did it—he would be known?”  “Yes. I tell you both, as sure as I stand here, I believe that Paul Armstrong looted his own bank. I believe he has a million at least, as the result, and that he will never come back. I’m worse than a pauper now. I can’t ask Louise to share nothing a year with me and when I think of this disgrace for her, I’m crazy.”  The most ordinary events of life seemed pregnant with possibilities that day, and when Halsey was called to the telephone, I ceased all pretense at eating. When he came back from the telephone his face showed that something had occurred. He waited, however, until Thomas left the dining-room: then he told us.  “Paul Armstrong is dead,” he announced gravely. “He died this morning in California. Whatever he did, he is beyond the law now.”  Gertrude turned pale.  “And the only man who could have cleared Jack can never do it!” she said despairingly.  “Also,” I replied coldly, “Mr. Armstrong is for ever beyond the power of defending himself. When your Jack comes to me, with some two hundred thousand dollars in his hands, which is about what you have lost, I shall believe him innocent.”  Halsey threw his cigarette away and turned on me.  “There you go!” he exclaimed. “If he was the thief, he could return the money, of course. If he is innocent, he probably hasn’t a tenth of that amount in the world. In his hands! That’s like a woman.”  Gertrude, who had been pale and despairing during the early part of the conversation, had flushed an indignant red. She got up and drew herself to her slender height, looking down at me with the scorn of the young and positive.  “You are the only mother I ever had,” she said tensely. “I have given you all I would have given my mother, had she lived—my love, my trust. And now, when I need you most, you fail me. I tell you, John Bailey is a good man, an honest man. If you say he is not, you—you—”  “Gertrude,” Halsey broke in sharply. She dropped beside the table and, burying her face in her arms broke into a storm of tears.  “I love him—love him,” she sobbed, in a surrender that was totally unlike her. “Oh, I never thought it would be like this. I can’t bear it. I can’t.”  Halsey and I stood helpless before the storm. I would have tried to comfort her, but she had put me away, and there was something aloof in her grief, something new and strange. At last, when her sorrow had subsided to the dry shaking sobs of a tired child, without raising her head she put out one groping hand.  “Aunt Ray!” she whispered. In a moment I was on my knees beside her, her arm around my neck, her cheek against my hair.  “Where am I in this?” Halsey said suddenly and tried to put his arms around us both. It was a welcome distraction, and Gertrude was soon herself again. The little storm had cleared the air. Nevertheless, my opinion remained unchanged. There was much to be cleared up before I would consent to any renewal of my acquaintance with John Bailey. And Halsey and Gertrude knew it, knowing me.     CHAPTER XI. HALSEY MAKES A CAPTURE   It was about half-past eight when we left the dining-room, and still engrossed with one subject, the failure of the bank and its attendant evils, Halsey and I went out into the grounds for a stroll. Gertrude followed us shortly. “The light was thickening,” to appropriate Shakespeare’s description of twilight, and once again the tree-toads and the crickets were making night throb with their tiny life. It was almost oppressively lonely, in spite of its beauty, and I felt a sickening pang of homesickness for my city at night—for the clatter of horses’ feet on cemented paving, for the lights, the voices, the sound of children playing. The country after dark oppresses me. The stars, quite eclipsed in the city by the electric lights, here become insistent, assertive. Whether I want to or not, I find myself looking for the few I know by name, and feeling ridiculously new and small by contrast—always an unpleasant sensation.  After Gertrude joined us, we avoided any further mention of the murder. To Halsey, as to me, there was ever present, I am sure, the thought of our conversation of the night before. As we strolled back and forth along the drive, Mr. Jamieson emerged from the shadow of the trees.  “Good evening,” he said, managing to include Gertrude in his bow.  Gertrude had never been even ordinarily courteous to him, and she nodded coldly. Halsey, however, was more cordial, although we were all constrained enough. He and Gertrude went on together, leaving the detective to walk with me. As soon as they were out of earshot, he turned to me.  “Do you know, Miss Innes,” he said, “the deeper I go into this thing, the more strange it seems to me. I am very sorry for Miss Gertrude. It looks as if Bailey, whom she has tried so hard to save, is worse than a rascal; and after her plucky fight for him, it seems hard.”  I looked through the dusk to where Gertrude’s light dinner dress gleamed among the trees. She HAD made a plucky fight, poor child. Whatever she might have been driven to do, I could find nothing but a deep sympathy for her. If she had only come to me with the whole truth then!  “Miss Innes,” Mr. Jamieson was saying, “in the last three days, have you seen a—any suspicious figures around the grounds? Any—woman?”  “No,” I replied. “I have a houseful of maids that will bear watching, one and all. But there has been no strange woman near the house or Liddy would have seen her, you may be sure. She has a telescopic eye.”  Mr. Jamieson looked thoughtful.  “It may not amount to anything,” he said slowly. “It is difficult to get any perspective on things around here, because every one down in the village is sure he saw the murderer, either before or since the crime. And half of them will stretch a point or two as to facts, to be obliging. But the man who drives the hack down there tells a story that may possibly prove to be important.”  “I have heard it, I think. Was it the one the parlor maid brought up yesterday, about a ghost wringing its hands on the roof? Or perhaps it’s the one the milk-boy heard: a tramp washing a dirty shirt, presumably bloody, in the creek below the bridge?”  I could see the gleam of Mr. Jamieson’s teeth, as he smiled.  “Neither,” he said. “But Matthew Geist, which is our friend’s name, claims that on Saturday night, at nine-thirty, a veiled lady—”  “I knew it would be a veiled lady,” I broke in.  “A veiled lady,” he persisted, “who was apparently young and beautiful, engaged his hack and asked to be driven to Sunnyside. Near the gate, however, she made him stop, in spite of his remonstrances, saying she preferred to walk to the house. She paid him, and he left her there. Now, Miss Innes, you had no such visitor, I believe?”  “None,” I said decidedly.  “Geist thought it might be a maid, as you had got a supply that day. But he said her getting out near the gate puzzled him. Anyhow, we have now one veiled lady, who, with the ghostly intruder of Friday night, makes two assets that I hardly know what to do with.”  “It is mystifying,” I admitted, “although I can think of one possible explanation. The path from the Greenwood Club to the village enters the road near the lodge gate. A woman who wished to reach the Country Club, unperceived, might choose such a method. There are plenty of women there.”  I think this gave him something to ponder, for in a short time he said good night and left. But I myself was far from satisfied. I was determined, however, on one thing. If my suspicions—for I had suspicions—were true, I would make my own investigations, and Mr. Jamieson should learn only what was good for him to know.  We went back to the house, and Gertrude, who was more like herself since her talk with Halsey, sat down at the mahogany desk in the living-room to write a letter. Halsey prowled up and down the entire east wing, now in the card-room, now in the billiard-room, and now and then blowing his clouds of tobacco smoke among the pink and gold hangings of the drawing-room. After a little I joined him in the billiard-room, and together we went over the details of the discovery of the body.  The card-room was quite dark. Where we sat, in the billiard-room, only one of the side brackets was lighted, and we spoke in subdued tones, as the hour and the subject seemed to demand. When I spoke of the figure Liddy and I had seen on the porch through the card-room window Friday night, Halsey sauntered into the darkened room, and together we stood there, much as Liddy and I had done that other night.  The window was the same grayish rectangle in the blackness as before. A few feet away in the hall was the spot where the body of Arnold Armstrong had been found. I was a bit nervous, and I put my hand on Halsey’s sleeve. Suddenly, from the top of the staircase above us came the sound of a cautious footstep. At first I was not sure, but Halsey’s attitude told me he had heard and was listening. The step, slow, measured, infinitely cautious, was nearer now. Halsey tried to loosen my fingers, but I was in a paralysis of fright.  The swish of a body against the curving rail, as if for guidance, was plain enough, and now whoever it was had reached the foot of the staircase and had caught a glimpse of our rigid silhouettes against the billiard-room doorway. Halsey threw me off then and strode forward.  “Who is it?” he called imperiously, and took a half dozen rapid strides toward the foot of the staircase. Then I heard him mutter something; there was the crash of a falling body, the slam of the outer door, and, for an instant, quiet. I screamed, I think. Then I remember turning on the lights and finding Halsey, white with fury, trying to untangle himself from something warm and fleecy. He had cut his forehead a little on the lowest step of the stairs, and he was rather a ghastly sight.  He flung the white object at me, and, jerking open the outer door, raced into the darkness.  Gertrude had come on hearing the noise, and now we stood, staring at each other over—of all things on earth—a white silk and wool blanket, exquisitely fine! It was the most unghostly thing in the world, with its lavender border and its faint scent. Gertrude was the first to speak.  “Somebody—had it?” she asked.  “Yes. Halsey tried to stop whoever it was and fell. Gertrude, that blanket is not mine. I have never seen before.”  She held it up and looked at it: then she went to the door on to the veranda and threw it open. Perhaps a hundred feet from the house were two figures, that moved slowly toward us as we looked.  When they came within range of the light, I recognized Halsey, and with him Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper.     CHAPTER XII. ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER   The most commonplace incident takes on a new appearance if the attendant circumstances are unusual. There was no reason on earth why Mrs. Watson should not have carried a blanket down the east wing staircase, if she so desired. But to take a blanket down at eleven o’clock at night, with every precaution as to noise, and, when discovered, to fling it at Halsey and bolt—Halsey’s word, and a good one—into the grounds,—this made the incident more than significant.  They moved slowly across the lawn and up the steps. Halsey was talking quietly, and Mrs. Watson was looking down and listening. She was a woman of a certain amount of dignity, most efficient, so far as I could see, although Liddy would have found fault if she dared. But just now Mrs. Watson’s face was an enigma. She was defiant, I think, under her mask of submission, and she still showed the effect of nervous shock.  “Mrs. Watson,” I said severely, “will you be so good as to explain this rather unusual occurrence?”  “I don’t think it so unusual, Miss Innes.” Her voice was deep and very clear: just now it was somewhat tremulous. “I was taking a blanket down to Thomas, who is—not well to-night, and I used this staircase, as being nearer the path to the lodge. When—Mr. Innes called and then rushed at me, I—I was alarmed, and flung the blanket at him.”  Halsey was examining the cut on his forehead in a small mirror on the wall. It was not much of an injury, but it had bled freely, and his appearance was rather terrifying.  “Thomas ill?” he said, over his shoulder. “Why, _I_ thought I saw Thomas out there as you made that cyclonic break out of the door and over the porch.”  I could see that under pretense of examining his injury he was watching her through the mirror.  “Is this one of the servants’ blankets, Mrs. Watson?” I asked, holding up its luxurious folds to the light.  “Everything else is locked away,” she replied. Which was true enough, no doubt. I had rented the house without bed furnishings.  “If Thomas is ill,” Halsey said, “some member of the family ought to go down to see him. You needn’t bother, Mrs. Watson. I will take the blanket.”  She drew herself up quickly, as if in protest, but she found nothing to say. She stood smoothing the folds of her dead black dress, her face as white as chalk above it. Then she seemed to make up her mind.  “Very well, Mr. Innes,” she said. “Perhaps you would better go. I have done all I could.”  And then she turned and went up the circular staircase, moving slowly and with a certain dignity. Below, the three of us stared at one another across the intervening white blanket.  “Upon my word,” Halsey broke out, “this place is a walking nightmare. I have the feeling that we three outsiders who have paid our money for the privilege of staying in this spook-factory, are living on the very top of things. We’re on the lid, so to speak. Now and then we get a sight of the things inside, but we are not a part of them.”  “Do you suppose,” Gertrude asked doubtfully, “that she really meant that blanket for Thomas?”  “Thomas was standing beside that magnolia tree,” Halsey replied, “when I ran after Mrs. Watson. It’s down to this, Aunt Ray. Rosie’s basket and Mrs. Watson’s blanket can only mean one thing: there is somebody hiding or being hidden in the lodge. It wouldn’t surprise me if we hold the key to the whole situation now. Anyhow, I’m going to the lodge to investigate.”  Gertrude wanted to go, too, but she looked so shaken that I insisted she should not. I sent for Liddy to help her to bed, and then Halsey and I started for the lodge. The grass was heavy with dew, and, man-like, Halsey chose the shortest way across the lawn. Half-way, however, he stopped.  “We’d better go by the drive,” he said. “This isn’t a lawn; it’s a field. Where’s the gardener these days?”  “There isn’t any,” I said meekly. “We have been thankful enough, so far, to have our meals prepared and served and the beds aired. The gardener who belongs here is working at the club.”  “Remind me to-morrow to send out a man from town,” he said. “I know the very fellow.”  I record this scrap of conversation, just as I have tried to put down anything and everything that had a bearing on what followed, because the gardener Halsey sent the next day played an important part in the events of the next few weeks—events that culminated, as you know, by stirring the country profoundly. At that time, however, I was busy trying to keep my skirts dry, and paid little or no attention to what seemed then a most trivial remark.  Along the drive I showed Halsey where I had found Rosie’s basket with the bits of broken china piled inside. He was rather skeptical.  “Warner probably,” he said when I had finished. “Began it as a joke on Rosie, and ended by picking up the broken china out of the road, knowing it would play hob with the tires of the car.” Which shows how near one can come to the truth, and yet miss it altogether.  At the lodge everything was quiet. There was a light in the sitting-room down-stairs, and a faint gleam, as if from a shaded lamp, in one of the upper rooms. Halsey stopped and examined the lodge with calculating eyes.  “I don’t know, Aunt Ray,” he said dubiously; “this is hardly a woman’s affair. If there’s a scrap of any kind, you hike for the timber.” Which was Halsey’s solicitous care for me, put into vernacular.  “I shall stay right here,” I said, and crossing the small veranda, now shaded and fragrant with honeysuckle, I hammered the knocker on the door.  Thomas opened the door himself—Thomas, fully dressed and in his customary health. I had the blanket over my arm.  “I brought the blanket, Thomas,” I said; “I am sorry you are so ill.”  The old man stood staring at me and then at the blanket. His confusion under other circumstances would have been ludicrous.  “What! Not ill?” Halsey said from the step. “Thomas, I’m afraid you’ve been malingering.”  Thomas seemed to have been debating something with himself. Now he stepped out on the porch and closed the door gently behind him.  “I reckon you bettah come in, Mis’ Innes,” he said, speaking cautiously. “It’s got so I dunno what to do, and it’s boun’ to come out some time er ruther.”  He threw the door open then, and I stepped inside, Halsey close behind. In the sitting-room the old negro turned with quiet dignity to Halsey.  “You bettah sit down, sah,” he said. “It’s a place for a woman, sah.”  Things were not turning out the way Halsey expected. He sat down on the center-table, with his hands thrust in his pockets, and watched me as I followed Thomas up the narrow stairs. At the top a woman was standing, and a second glance showed me it was Rosie.  She shrank back a little, but I said nothing. And then Thomas motioned to a partly open door, and I went in.  The lodge boasted three bedrooms up-stairs, all comfortably furnished. In this one, the largest and airiest, a night lamp was burning, and by its light I could make out a plain white metal bed. A girl was asleep there—or in a half stupor, for she muttered something now and then. Rosie had taken her courage in her hands, and coming in had turned up the light. It was only then that I knew. Fever-flushed, ill as she was, I recognized Louise Armstrong.  I stood gazing down at her in a stupor of amazement. Louise here, hiding at the lodge, ill and alone! Rosie came up to the bed and smoothed the white counterpane.  “I am afraid she is worse to-night,” she ventured at last. I put my hand on the sick girl’s forehead. It was burning with fever, and I turned to where Thomas lingered in the hallway.  “Will you tell me what you mean, Thomas Johnson, by not telling me this before?” I demanded indignantly.  Thomas quailed.  “Mis’ Louise wouldn’ let me,” he said earnestly. “I wanted to. She ought to ’a’ had a doctor the night she came, but she wouldn’ hear to it. Is she—is she very bad, Mis’ Innes?”  “Bad enough,” I said coldly. “Send Mr. Innes up.”  Halsey came up the stairs slowly, looking rather interested and inclined to be amused. For a moment he could not see anything distinctly in the darkened room; he stopped, glanced at Rosie and at me, and then his eyes fell on the restless head on the pillow.  I think he felt who it was before he really saw her; he crossed the room in a couple of strides and bent over the bed.  “Louise!” he said softly; but she did not reply, and her eyes showed no recognition. Halsey was young, and illness was new to him. He straightened himself slowly, still watching her, and caught my arm.  “She’s dying, Aunt Ray!” he said huskily. “Dying! Why, she doesn’t know me!”  “Fudge!” I snapped, being apt to grow irritable when my sympathies are aroused. “She’s doing nothing of the sort,—and don’t pinch my arm. If you want something to do, go and choke Thomas.”  But at that moment Louise roused from her stupor to cough, and at the end of the paroxysm, as Rosie laid her back, exhausted, she knew us. That was all Halsey wanted; to him consciousness was recovery. He dropped on his knees beside the bed, and tried to tell her she was all right, and we would bring her around in a hurry, and how beautiful she looked—only to break down utterly and have to stop. And at that I came to my senses, and put him out.  “This instant!” I ordered, as he hesitated. “And send Rosie here.”  He did not go far. He sat on the top step of the stairs, only leaving to telephone for a doctor, and getting in everybody’s way in his eagerness to fetch and carry. I got him away finally, by sending him to fix up the car as a sort of ambulance, in case the doctor would allow the sick girl to be moved. He sent Gertrude down to the lodge loaded with all manner of impossible things, including an armful of Turkish towels and a box of mustard plasters, and as the two girls had known each other somewhat before, Louise brightened perceptibly when she saw her.  When the doctor from Englewood—the Casanova doctor, Doctor Walker, being away—had started for Sunnyside, and I had got Thomas to stop trying to explain what he did not understand himself, I had a long talk with the old man, and this is what I learned.  On Saturday evening before, about ten o’clock, he had been reading in the sitting-room down-stairs, when some one rapped at the door. The old man was alone, Warner not having arrived, and at first he was uncertain about opening the door. He did so finally, and was amazed at being confronted by Louise Armstrong. Thomas was an old family servant, having been with the present Mrs. Armstrong since she was a child, and he was overwhelmed at seeing Louise. He saw that she was excited and tired, and he drew her into the sitting-room and made her sit down. After a while he went to the house and brought Mrs. Watson, and they talked until late. The old man said Louise was in trouble, and seemed frightened. Mrs. Watson made some tea and took it to the lodge, but Louise made them both promise to keep her presence a secret. She had not known that Sunnyside was rented, and whatever her trouble was, this complicated things. She seemed puzzled. Her stepfather and her mother were still in California—that was all she would say about them. Why she had run away no one could imagine. Mr. Arnold Armstrong was at the Greenwood Club, and at last Thomas, not knowing what else to do, went over there along the path. It was almost midnight. Part-way over he met Armstrong himself and brought him to the lodge. Mrs. Watson had gone to the house for some bed-linen, it having been arranged that under the circumstances Louise would be better at the lodge until morning. Arnold Armstrong and Louise had a long conference, during which he was heard to storm and become very violent. When he left it was after two. He had gone up to the house—Thomas did not know why—and at three o’clock he was shot at the foot of the circular staircase.  The following morning Louise had been ill. She had asked for Arnold, and was told he had left town. Thomas had not the moral courage to tell her of the crime. She refused a doctor, and shrank morbidly from having her presence known. Mrs. Watson and Thomas had had their hands full, and at last Rosie had been enlisted to help them. She carried necessary provisions—little enough—to the lodge, and helped to keep the secret.  Thomas told me quite frankly that he had been anxious to keep Louise’s presence hidden for this reason: they had all seen Arnold Armstrong that night, and he, himself, for one, was known to have had no very friendly feeling for the dead man. As to the reason for Louise’s flight from California, or why she had not gone to the Fitzhughs’, or to some of her people in town, he had no more information than I had. With the death of her stepfather and the prospect of the immediate return of the family, things had become more and more impossible. I gathered that Thomas was as relieved as I at the turn events had taken. No, she did not know of either of the deaths in the family.  Taken all around, I had only substituted one mystery for another.  If I knew now why Rosie had taken the basket of dishes, I did not know who had spoken to her and followed her along the drive. If I knew that Louise was in the lodge, I did not know why she was there. If I knew that Arnold Armstrong had spent some time in the lodge the night before he was murdered, I was no nearer the solution of the crime. Who was the midnight intruder who had so alarmed Liddy and myself? Who had fallen down the clothes chute? Was Gertrude’s lover a villain or a victim? Time was to answer all these things.     CHAPTER XIII. LOUISE   The doctor from Englewood came very soon, and I went up to see the sick girl with him. Halsey had gone to supervise the fitting of the car with blankets and pillows, and Gertrude was opening and airing Louise’s own rooms at the house. Her private sitting-room, bedroom and dressing-room were as they had been when we came. They occupied the end of the east wing, beyond the circular staircase, and we had not even opened them.  The girl herself was too ill to notice what was being done. When, with the help of the doctor, who was a fatherly man with a family of girls at home, we got her to the house and up the stairs into bed, she dropped into a feverish sleep, which lasted until morning. Doctor Stewart—that was the Englewood doctor—stayed almost all night, giving the medicine himself, and watching her closely. Afterward he told me that she had had a narrow escape from pneumonia, and that the cerebral symptoms had been rather alarming. I said I was glad it wasn’t an “itis” of some kind, anyhow, and he smiled solemnly.  He left after breakfast, saying that he thought the worst of the danger was over, and that she must be kept very quiet.  “The shock of two deaths, I suppose, has done this,” he remarked, picking up his case. “It has been very deplorable.”  I hastened to set him right.  “She does not know of either, Doctor,” I said. “Please do not mention them to her.”  He looked as surprised as a medical man ever does.  “I do not know the family,” he said, preparing to get into his top buggy. “Young Walker, down in Casanova, has been attending them. I understand he is going to marry this young lady.”  “You have been misinformed,” I said stiffly. “Miss Armstrong is going to marry my nephew.”  The doctor smiled as he picked up the reins.  “Young ladies are changeable these days,” he said. “We thought the wedding was to occur soon. Well, I will stop in this afternoon to see how my patient is getting along.”  He drove away then, and I stood looking after him. He was a doctor of the old school, of the class of family practitioner that is fast dying out; a loyal and honorable gentleman who was at once physician and confidential adviser to his patients. When I was a girl we called in the doctor alike when we had measles, or when mother’s sister died in the far West. He cut out redundant tonsils and brought the babies with the same air of inspiring self-confidence. Nowadays it requires a different specialist for each of these occurrences. When the babies cried, old Doctor Wainwright gave them peppermint and dropped warm sweet oil in their ears with sublime faith that if it was not colic it was earache. When, at the end of a year, father met him driving in his high side-bar buggy with the white mare ambling along, and asked for a bill, the doctor used to go home, estimate what his services were worth for that period, divide it in half—I don’t think he kept any books—and send father a statement, in a cramped hand, on a sheet of ruled white paper. He was an honored guest at all the weddings, christenings, and funerals—yes, funerals—for every one knew he had done his best, and there was no gainsaying the ways of Providence.  Ah, well, Doctor Wainwright is gone, and I am an elderly woman with an increasing tendency to live in the past. The contrast between my old doctor at home and the Casanova doctor, Frank Walker, always rouses me to wrath and digression.  Some time about noon of that day, Wednesday, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh telephoned me. I have the barest acquaintance with her—she managed to be put on the governing board of the Old Ladies’ Home and ruins their digestions by sending them ice-cream and cake on every holiday. Beyond that, and her reputation at bridge, which is insufferably bad—she is the worst player at the bridge club—I know little of her. It was she who had taken charge of Arnold Armstrong’s funeral, however, and I went at once to the telephone.  “Yes,” I said, “this is Miss Innes.”  “Miss Innes,” she said volubly, “I have just received a very strange telegram from my cousin, Mrs. Armstrong. Her husband died yesterday, in California and—wait, I will read you the message.”  I knew what was coming, and I made up my mind at once. If Louise Armstrong had a good and sufficient reason for leaving her people and coming home, a reason, moreover, that kept her from going at once to Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, and that brought her to the lodge at Sunnyside instead, it was not my intention to betray her. Louise herself must notify her people. I do not justify myself now, but remember, I was in a peculiar position toward the Armstrong family. I was connected most unpleasantly with a cold-blooded crime, and my niece and nephew were practically beggared, either directly or indirectly, through the head of the family.  Mrs. Fitzhugh had found the message.  “‘Paul died yesterday. Heart disease,’” she read. “‘Wire at once if Louise is with you.’ You see, Miss Innes, Louise must have started east, and Fanny is alarmed about her.”  “Yes,” I said.  “Louise is not here,” Mrs. Fitzhugh went on, “and none of her friends—the few who are still in town—has seen her. I called you because Sunnyside was not rented when she went away, and Louise might have, gone there.”  “I am sorry, Mrs. Fitzhugh, but I can not help you,” I said, and was immediately filled with compunction. Suppose Louise grew worse? Who was I to play Providence in this case? The anxious mother certainly had a right to know that her daughter was in good hands. So I broke in on Mrs. Fitzhugh’s voluble excuses for disturbing me.  “Mrs. Fitzhugh,” I said. “I was going to let you think I knew nothing about Louise Armstrong, but I have changed my mind. Louise is here, with me.” There was a clatter of ejaculations at the other end of the wire. “She is ill, and not able to be moved. Moreover, she is unable to see any one. I wish you would wire her mother that she is with me, and tell her not to worry. No, I do not know why she came east.”  “But my dear Miss Innes!” Mrs. Fitzhugh began. I cut in ruthlessly.  “I will send for you as soon as she can see you,” I said. “No, she is not in a critical state now, but the doctor says she must have absolute quiet.”  When I had hung up the receiver, I sat down to think. So Louise had fled from her people in California, and had come east alone! It was not a new idea, but why had she done it? It occurred to me that Doctor Walker might be concerned in it, might possibly have bothered her with unwelcome attentions; but it seemed to me that Louise was hardly a girl to take refuge in flight under such circumstances. She had always been high-spirited, with the well-poised head and buoyant step of the outdoors girl. It must have been much more in keeping with Louise’s character, as I knew it, to resent vigorously any unwelcome attentions from Doctor Walker. It was the suitor whom I should have expected to see in headlong flight, not the lady in the case.  The puzzle was no clearer at the end of the half-hour. I picked up the morning papers, which were still full of the looting of the Traders’ Bank, the interest at fever height again, on account of Paul Armstrong’s death. The bank examiners were working on the books, and said nothing for publication: John Bailey had been released on bond. The body of Paul Armstrong would arrive Sunday and would be buried from the Armstrong town house. There were rumors that the dead man’s estate had been a comparatively small one. The last paragraph was the important one.  Walter P. Broadhurst, of the Marine Bank, had produced two hundred American Traction bonds, which had been placed as security with the Marine Bank for a loan of one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, made to Paul Armstrong, just before his California trip. The bonds were a part of the missing traction bonds from the Traders’ Bank! While this involved the late president of the wrecked bank, to my mind it by no means cleared its cashier.  The gardener mentioned by Halsey came out about two o’clock in the afternoon, and walked up from the station. I was favorably impressed by him. His references were good—he had been employed by the Brays’ until they went to Europe, and he looked young and vigorous. He asked for one assistant, and I was glad enough to get off so easily. He was a pleasant-faced young fellow, with black hair and blue eyes, and his name was Alexander Graham. I have been particular about Alex, because, as I said before, he played an important part later.  That afternoon I had a new insight into the character of the dead banker. I had my first conversation with Louise. She sent for me, and against my better judgment I went. There were so many things she could not be told, in her weakened condition, that I dreaded the interview. It was much easier than I expected, however, because she asked no questions.  Gertrude had gone to bed, having been up almost all night, and Halsey was absent on one of those mysterious absences of his that grew more and more frequent as time went on, until it culminated in the event of the night of June the tenth. Liddy was in attendance in the sick-room. There being little or nothing to do, she seemed to spend her time smoothing the wrinkles from the counterpane. Louise lay under a field of virgin white, folded back at an angle of geometrical exactness, and necessitating a readjustment every time the sick girl turned.  Liddy heard my approach and came out to meet me. She seemed to be in a perpetual state of goose-flesh, and she had got in the habit of looking past me when she talked, as if she saw things. It had the effect of making me look over my shoulder to see what she was staring at, and was intensely irritating.  “She’s awake,” Liddy said, looking uneasily down the circular staircase, which was beside me. “She was talkin’ in her sleep something awful—about dead men and coffins.”  “Liddy,” I said sternly, “did you breathe a word about everything not being right here?”  Liddy’s gaze had wandered to the door of the chute, now bolted securely.  “Not a word,” she said, “beyond asking her a question or two, which there was no harm in. She says there never was a ghost known here.”  I glared at her, speechless, and closing the door into Louise’s boudoir, to Liddy’s great disappointment, I went on to the bedroom beyond.  Whatever Paul Armstrong had been, he had been lavish with his stepdaughter. Gertrude’s rooms at home were always beautiful apartments, but the three rooms in the east wing at Sunnyside, set apart for the daughter of the house, were much more splendid.  From the walls to the rugs on the floor, from the furniture to the appointments of the bath, with its pool sunk in the floor instead of the customary unlovely tub, everything was luxurious. In the bedroom Louise was watching for me. It was easy to see that she was much improved; the flush was going, and the peculiar gasping breathing of the night before was now a comfortable and easy respiration.  She held out her hand and I took it between both of mine.  “What can I say to you, Miss Innes?” she said slowly. “To have come like this—”  I thought she was going to break down, but she did not.  “You are not to think of anything but of getting well,” I said, patting her hand. “When you are better, I am going to scold you for not coming here at once. This is your home, my dear, and of all people in the world, Halsey’s old aunt ought to make you welcome.”  She smiled a little, sadly, I thought.  “I ought not to see Halsey,” she said. “Miss Innes, there are a great many things you will never understand, I am afraid. I am an impostor on your sympathy, because I—I stay here and let you lavish care on me, and all the time I know you are going to despise me.”  “Nonsense!” I said briskly. “Why, what would Halsey do to me if I even ventured such a thing? He is so big and masterful that if I dared to be anything but rapturous over you, he would throw me out of a window. Indeed, he would be quite capable of it.”  She seemed scarcely to hear my facetious tone. She had eloquent brown eyes—the Inneses are fair, and are prone to a grayish-green optic that is better for use than appearance—and they seemed now to be clouded with trouble.  “Poor Halsey!” she said softly. “Miss Innes, I can not marry him, and I am afraid to tell him. I am a coward—a coward!”  I sat beside the bed and stared at her. She was too ill to argue with, and, besides, sick people take queer fancies.  “We will talk about that when you are stronger,” I said gently.  “But there are some things I must tell you,” she insisted. “You must wonder how I came here, and why I stayed hidden at the lodge. Dear old Thomas has been almost crazy, Miss Innes. I did not know that Sunnyside was rented. I knew my mother wished to rent it, without telling my—stepfather, but the news must have reached her after I left. When I started east, I had only one idea—to be alone with my thoughts for a time, to bury myself here. Then, I—must have taken a cold on the train.”  “You came east in clothing suitable for California,” I said, “and, like all young girls nowadays, I don’t suppose you wear flannels.” But she was not listening.  “Miss Innes,” she said, “has my stepbrother Arnold gone away?”  “What do you mean?” I asked, startled. But Louise was literal.  “He didn’t come back that night,” she said, “and it was so important that I should see him.”  “I believe he has gone away,” I replied uncertainly. “Isn’t it something that we could attend to instead?”  But she shook her head. “I must do it myself,” she said dully. “My mother must have rented Sunnyside without telling my stepfather, and—Miss Innes, did you ever hear of any one being wretchedly poor in the midst of luxury?  “Did you ever long, and long, for money—money to use without question, money that no one would take you to task about? My mother and I have been surrounded for years with every indulgence everything that would make a display. But we have never had any money, Miss Innes; that must have been why mother rented this house. My stepfather pays our bills. It’s the most maddening, humiliating existence in the world. I would love honest poverty better.”  “Never mind,” I said; “when you and Halsey are married you can be as honest as you like, and you will certainly be poor.”  Halsey came to the door at that moment and I could hear him coaxing Liddy for admission to the sick room.  “Shall I bring him in?” I asked Louise, uncertain what to do. The girl seemed to shrink back among her pillows at the sound of his voice. I was vaguely irritated with her; there are few young fellows like Halsey—straightforward, honest, and willing to sacrifice everything for the one woman. I knew one once, more than thirty years ago, who was like that: he died a long time ago. And sometimes I take out his picture, with its cane and its queer silk hat, and look at it. But of late years it has grown too painful: he is always a boy—and I am an old woman. I would not bring him back if I could.  Perhaps it was some such memory that made me call out sharply.  “Come in, Halsey.” And then I took my sewing and went into the boudoir beyond, to play propriety. I did not try to hear what they said, but every word came through the open door with curious distinctness. Halsey had evidently gone over to the bed and I suppose he kissed her. There was silence for a moment, as if words were superfluous things.  “I have been almost wild, sweetheart,”—Halsey’s voice. “Why didn’t you trust me, and send for me before?”  “It was because I couldn’t trust myself,” she said in a low tone. “I am too weak to struggle to-day; oh, Halsey, how I have wanted to see you!”  There was something I did not hear, then Halsey again.  “We could go away,” he was saying. “What does it matter about any one in the world but just the two of us? To be always together, like this, hand in hand; Louise—don’t tell me it isn’t going to be. I won’t believe you.”  “You don’t know; you don’t know,” Louise repeated dully. “Halsey, I care—you know that—but—not enough to marry you.”  “That is not true, Louise,” he said sternly. “You can not look at me with your honest eyes and say that.”  “I can not marry you,” she repeated miserably. “It’s bad enough, isn’t it? Don’t make it worse. Some day, before long, you will be glad.”  “Then it is because you have never loved me.” There were depths of hurt pride in his voice. “You saw how much I loved you, and you let me think you cared—for a while. No—that isn’t like you, Louise. There is something you haven’t told me. Is it—because there is some one else?”  “Yes,” almost inaudibly.  “Louise! Oh, I don’t believe it.”  “It is true,” she said sadly. “Halsey, you must not try to see me again. As soon as I can, I am going away from here—where you are all so much kinder than I deserve. And whatever you hear about me, try to think as well of me as you can. I am going to marry—another man. How you must hate me—hate me!”  I could hear Halsey cross the room to the window. Then, after a pause, he went back to her again. I could hardly sit still; I wanted to go in and give her a good shaking.  “Then it’s all over,” he was saying with a long breath. “The plans we made together, the hopes, the—all of it—over! Well, I’ll not be a baby, and I’ll give you up the minute you say ‘I don’t love you and I do love—some one else’!”  “I can not say that,” she breathed, “but, very soon, I shall marry—the other man.”  I could hear Halsey’s low triumphant laugh.  “I defy him,” he said. “Sweetheart, as long as you care for me, I am not afraid.”  The wind slammed the door between the two rooms just then, and I could hear nothing more, although I moved my chair quite close. After a discreet interval, I went into the other room, and found Louise alone. She was staring with sad eyes at the cherub painted on the ceiling over the bed, and because she looked tired I did not disturb her.     CHAPTER XIV. AN EGG-NOG AND A TELEGRAM   We had discovered Louise at the lodge Tuesday night. It was Wednesday I had my interview with her. Thursday and Friday were uneventful, save as they marked improvement in our patient. Gertrude spent almost all the time with her, and the two had grown to be great friends. But certain things hung over me constantly; the coroner’s inquest on the death of Arnold Armstrong, to be held Saturday, and the arrival of Mrs. Armstrong and young Doctor Walker, bringing the body of the dead president of the Traders’ Bank. We had not told Louise of either death.  Then, too, I was anxious about the children. With their mother’s inheritance swept away in the wreck of the bank, and with their love affairs in a disastrous condition, things could scarcely be worse. Added to that, the cook and Liddy had a flare-up over the proper way to make beef-tea for Louise, and, of course, the cook left.  Mrs. Watson had been glad enough, I think, to turn Louise over to our care, and Thomas went upstairs night and morning to greet his young mistress from the doorway. Poor Thomas! He had the faculty—found still in some old negroes, who cling to the traditions of slavery days—of making his employer’s interest his. It was always “we” with Thomas; I miss him sorely; pipe-smoking, obsequious, not over reliable, kindly old man!  On Thursday Mr. Harton, the Armstrongs’ legal adviser, called up from town. He had been advised, he said, that Mrs. Armstrong was coming east with her husband’s body and would arrive Monday. He came with some hesitation, he went on, to the fact that he had been further instructed to ask me to relinquish my lease on Sunnyside, as it was Mrs. Armstrong’s desire to come directly there.  I was aghast.  “Here!” I said. “Surely you are mistaken, Mr. Harton. I should think, after—what happened here only a few days ago, she would never wish to come back.”  “Nevertheless,” he replied, “she is most anxious to come. This is what she says. ‘Use every possible means to have Sunnyside vacated. Must go there at once.’”  “Mr. Harton,” I said testily, “I am not going to do anything of the kind. I and mine have suffered enough at the hands of this family. I rented the house at an exorbitant figure and I have moved out here for the summer. My city home is dismantled and in the hands of decorators. I have been here one week, during which I have had not a single night of uninterrupted sleep, and I intend to stay until I have recuperated. Moreover, if Mr. Armstrong died insolvent, as I believe was the case, his widow ought to be glad to be rid of so expensive a piece of property.”  The lawyer cleared his throat.  “I am very sorry you have made this decision,” he said. “Miss Innes, Mrs. Fitzhugh tells me Louise Armstrong is with you.”  “She is.”  “Has she been informed of this—double bereavement?”  “Not yet,” I said. “She has been very ill; perhaps to-night she can be told.”  “It is very sad; very sad,” he said. “I have a telegram for her, Mrs. Innes. Shall I send it out?”  “Better open it and read it to me,” I suggested. “If it is important, that will save time.”  There was a pause while Mr. Harton opened the telegram. Then he read it slowly, judicially.  “‘Watch for Nina Carrington. Home Monday. Signed F. L. W.’”  “Hum!” I said. “‘Watch for Nina Carrington. Home Monday.’ Very well, Mr. Harton, I will tell her, but she is not in condition to watch for any one.”  “Well, Miss Innes, if you decide to—er—relinquish the lease, let me know,” the lawyer said.  “I shall not relinquish it,” I replied, and I imagined his irritation from the way he hung up the receiver.  I wrote the telegram down word for word, afraid to trust my memory, and decided to ask Doctor Stewart how soon Louise might be told the truth. The closing of the Traders’ Bank I considered unnecessary for her to know, but the death of her stepfather and stepbrother must be broken to her soon, or she might hear it in some unexpected and shocking manner.  Doctor Stewart came about four o’clock, bringing his leather satchel into the house with a great deal of care, and opening it at the foot of the stairs to show me a dozen big yellow eggs nesting among the bottles.  “Real eggs,” he said proudly. “None of your anemic store eggs, but the real thing—some of them still warm. Feel them! Egg-nog for Miss Louise.”  He was beaming with satisfaction, and before he left, he insisted on going back to the pantry and making an egg-nog with his own hands. Somehow, all the time he was doing it, I had a vision of Doctor Willoughby, my nerve specialist in the city, trying to make an egg-nog. I wondered if he ever prescribed anything so plebeian—and so delicious. And while Doctor Stewart whisked the eggs he talked.  “I said to Mrs. Stewart,” he confided, a little red in the face from the exertion, “after I went home the other day, that you would think me an old gossip, for saying what I did about Walker and Miss Louise.”  “Nothing of the sort,” I protested.  “The fact is,” he went on, evidently justifying him self, “I got that piece of information just as we get a lot of things, through the kitchen end of the house. Young Walker’s chauffeur—Walker’s more fashionable than I am, and he goes around the country in a Stanhope car—well, his chauffeur comes to see our servant girl, and he told her the whole thing. I thought it was probable, because Walker spent a lot of time up here last summer, when the family was here, and besides, Riggs, that’s Walker’s man, had a very pat little story about the doctor’s building a house on this property, just at the foot of the hill. The sugar, please.”  The egg-nog was finished. Drop by drop the liquor had cooked the egg, and now, with a final whisk, a last toss in the shaker, it was ready, a symphony in gold and white. The doctor sniffed it.  “Real eggs, real milk, and a touch of real Kentucky whisky,” he said.  He insisted on carrying it up himself, but at the foot of the stairs he paused.  “Riggs said the plans were drawn for the house,” he said, harking back to the old subject. “Drawn by Huston in town. So I naturally believed him.”  When the doctor came down, I was ready with a question.  “Doctor,” I asked, “is there any one in the neighborhood named Carrington? Nina Carrington?”  “Carrington?” He wrinkled his forehead. “Carrington? No, I don’t remember any such family. There used to be Covingtons down the creek.”  “The name was Carrington,” I said, and the subject lapsed.  Gertrude and Halsey went for a long walk that afternoon, and Louise slept. Time hung heavy on my hands, and I did as I had fallen into a habit of doing lately—I sat down and thought things over. One result of my meditations was that I got up suddenly and went to the telephone. I had taken the most intense dislike to this Doctor Walker, whom I had never seen, and who was being talked of in the countryside as the fiance of Louise Armstrong.  I knew Sam Huston well. There had been a time, when Sam was a good deal younger than he is now, before he had married Anne Endicott, when I knew him even better. So now I felt no hesitation in calling him over the telephone. But when his office boy had given way to his confidential clerk, and that functionary had condescended to connect his employer’s desk telephone, I was somewhat at a loss as to how to begin.  “Why, how are you, Rachel?” Sam said sonorously. “Going to build that house at Rock View?” It was a twenty-year-old joke of his.  “Sometime, perhaps,” I said. “Just now I want to ask you a question about something which is none of my business.”  “I see you haven’t changed an iota in a quarter of a century, Rachel.” This was intended to be another jest. “Ask ahead: everything but my domestic affairs is at your service.”  “Try to be serious,” I said. “And tell me this: has your firm made any plans for a house recently, for a Doctor Walker, at Casanova?”  “Yes, we have.”  “Where was it to be built? I have a reason for asking.”  “It was to be, I believe, on the Armstrong place. Mr. Armstrong himself consulted me, and the inference was—in fact, I am quite certain—the house was to be occupied by Mr. Armstrong’s daughter, who was engaged to marry Doctor Walker.”  When the architect had inquired for the different members of my family, and had finally rung off, I was certain of one thing. Louise Armstrong was in love with Halsey, and the man she was going to marry was Doctor Walker. Moreover, this decision was not new; marriage had been contemplated for some time. There must certainly be some explanation—but what was it?  That day I repeated to Louise the telegram Mr. Warton had opened.  She seemed to understand, but an unhappier face I have never seen. She looked like a criminal whose reprieve is over, and the day of execution approaching.     CHAPTER XV. LIDDY GIVES THE ALARM   The next day, Friday, Gertrude broke the news of her stepfather’s death to Louise. She did it as gently as she could, telling her first that he was very ill, and finally that he was dead. Louise received the news in the most unexpected manner, and when Gertrude came out to tell me how she had stood it, I think she was almost shocked.  “She just lay and stared at me, Aunt Ray,” she said. “Do you know, I believe she is glad, glad! And she is too honest to pretend anything else. What sort of man was Mr. Paul Armstrong, anyhow?”  “He was a bully as well as a rascal, Gertrude,” I said. “But I am convinced of one thing; Louise will send for Halsey now, and they will make it all up.”  For Louise had steadily refused to see Halsey all that day, and the boy was frantic.  We had a quiet hour, Halsey and I, that evening, and I told him several things; about the request that we give up the lease to Sunnyside, about the telegram to Louise, about the rumors of an approaching marriage between the girl and Doctor Walker, and, last of all, my own interview with her the day before.  He sat back in a big chair, with his face in the shadow, and my heart fairly ached for him. He was so big and so boyish! When I had finished he drew a long breath.  “Whatever Louise does,” he said, “nothing will convince me, Aunt Ray, that she doesn’t care for me. And up to two months ago, when she and her mother went west, I was the happiest fellow on earth. Then something made a difference: she wrote me that her people were opposed to the marriage; that her feeling for me was what it had always been, but that something had happened which had changed her ideas as to the future. I was not to write until she wrote me, and whatever occurred, I was to think the best I could of her. It sounded like a puzzle. When I saw her yesterday, it was the same thing, only, perhaps, worse.”  “Halsey,” I asked, “have you any idea of the nature of the interview between Louise Armstrong and Arnold the night he was murdered?”  “It was stormy. Thomas says once or twice he almost broke into the room, he was so alarmed for Louise.”  “Another thing, Halsey,” I said, “have you ever heard Louise mention a woman named Carrington, Nina Carrington?”  “Never,” he said positively.  For try as we would, our thoughts always came back to that fatal Saturday night, and the murder. Every conversational path led to it, and we all felt that Jamieson was tightening the threads of evidence around John Bailey. The detective’s absence was hardly reassuring; he must have had something to work on in town, or he would have returned.  The papers reported that the cashier of the Traders’ Bank was ill in his apartments at the Knickerbocker—a condition not surprising, considering everything. The guilt of the defunct president was no longer in doubt; the missing bonds had been advertised and some of them discovered. In every instance they had been used as collateral for large loans, and the belief was current that not less than a million and a half dollars had been realized. Every one connected with the bank had been placed under arrest, and released on heavy bond.  Was he alone in his guilt, or was the cashier his accomplice? Where was the money? The estate of the dead man was comparatively small—a city house on a fashionable street, Sunnyside, a large estate largely mortgaged, an insurance of fifty thousand dollars, and some personal property—this was all.  The rest lost in speculation probably, the papers said. There was one thing which looked uncomfortable for Jack Bailey: he and Paul Armstrong together had promoted a railroad company in New Mexico, and it was rumored that together they had sunk large sums of money there. The business alliance between the two men added to the belief that Bailey knew something of the looting. His unexplained absence from the bank on Monday lent color to the suspicion against him. The strange thing seemed to be his surrendering himself on the point of departure. To me, it seemed the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal. I was not actively antagonistic to Gertrude’s lover, but I meant to be convinced, one way or the other. I took no one on faith.  That night the Sunnyside ghost began to walk again. Liddy had been sleeping in Louise’s dressing-room on a couch, and the approach of dusk was a signal for her to barricade the entire suite. Situated as it was, beyond the circular staircase, nothing but an extremity of excitement would have made her pass it after dark. I confess myself that the place seemed to me to have a sinister appearance, but we kept that wing well lighted, and until the lights went out at midnight it was really cheerful, if one did not know its history.  On Friday night, then, I had gone to bed, resolved to go at once to sleep. Thoughts that insisted on obtruding themselves I pushed resolutely to the back of my mind, and I systematically relaxed every muscle. I fell asleep soon, and was dreaming that Doctor Walker was building his new house immediately in front of my windows: I could hear the thump-thump of the hammers, and then I waked to a knowledge that somebody was pounding on my door.  I was up at once, and with the sound of my footstep on the floor the low knocking ceased, to be followed immediately by sibilant whispering through the keyhole.  “Miss Rachel! Miss Rachel!” somebody was saying, over and over.  “Is that you, Liddy?” I asked, my hand on the knob.  “For the love of mercy, let me in!” she said in a low tone.  She was leaning against the door, for when I opened it, she fell in. She was greenish-white, and she had a red and black barred flannel petticoat over her shoulders.  “Listen,” she said, standing in the middle of the floor and holding on to me. “Oh, Miss Rachel, it’s the ghost of that dead man hammering to get in!”  Sure enough, there was a dull thud—thud—thud from some place near. It was muffled: one rather felt than heard it, and it was impossible to locate. One moment it seemed to come, three taps and a pause, from the floor under us: the next, thud—thud—thud—it came apparently from the wall.  “It’s not a ghost,” I said decidedly. “If it was a ghost it wouldn’t rap: it would come through the keyhole.” Liddy looked at the keyhole. “But it sounds very much as though some one is trying to break into the house.”  Liddy was shivering violently. I told her to get me my slippers and she brought me a pair of kid gloves, so I found my things myself, and prepared to call Halsey. As before, the night alarm had found the electric lights gone: the hall, save for its night lamp, was in darkness, as I went across to Halsey’s room. I hardly know what I feared, but it was a relief to find him there, very sound asleep, and with his door unlocked.  “Wake up, Halsey,” I said, shaking him.  He stirred a little. Liddy was half in and half out of the door, afraid as usual to be left alone, and not quite daring to enter. Her scruples seemed to fade, however, all at once. She gave a suppressed yell, bolted into the room, and stood tightly clutching the foot-board of the bed. Halsey was gradually waking.  “I’ve seen it,” Liddy wailed. “A woman in white down the hall!”  I paid no attention.  “Halsey,” I persevered, “some one is breaking into the house. Get up, won’t you?”  “It isn’t our house,” he said sleepily. And then he roused to the exigency of the occasion. “All right, Aunt Ray,” he said, still yawning. “If you’ll let me get into something—”  It was all I could do to get Liddy out of the room. The demands of the occasion had no influence on her: she had seen the ghost, she persisted, and she wasn’t going into the hall. But I got her over to my room at last, more dead than alive, and made her lie down on the bed.  The tappings, which seemed to have ceased for a while, had commenced again, but they were fainter. Halsey came over in a few minutes, and stood listening and trying to locate the sound.  “Give me my revolver, Aunt Ray,” he said; and I got it—the one I had found in the tulip bed—and gave it to him. He saw Liddy there and divined at once that Louise was alone.  “You let me attend to this fellow, whoever it is, Aunt Ray, and go to Louise, will you? She may be awake and alarmed.”  So in spite of her protests, I left Liddy alone and went back to the east wing. Perhaps I went a little faster past the yawning blackness of the circular staircase; and I could hear Halsey creaking cautiously down the main staircase. The rapping, or pounding, had ceased, and the silence was almost painful. And then suddenly, from apparently under my very feet, there rose a woman’s scream, a cry of terror that broke off as suddenly as it came. I stood frozen and still. Every drop of blood in my body seemed to leave the surface and gather around my heart. In the dead silence that followed it throbbed as if it would burst. More dead than alive, I stumbled into Louise’s bedroom. She was not there!     CHAPTER XVI. IN THE EARLY MORNING   I stood looking at the empty bed. The coverings had been thrown back, and Louise’s pink silk dressing-gown was gone from the foot, where it had lain. The night lamp burned dimly, revealing the emptiness of the place. I picked it up, but my hand shook so that I put it down again, and got somehow to the door.  There were voices in the hall and Gertrude came running toward me.  “What is it?” she cried. “What was that sound? Where is Louise?”  “She is not in her room,” I said stupidly. “I think—it was she—who screamed.”  Liddy had joined us now, carrying a light. We stood huddled together at the head of the circular staircase, looking down into its shadows. There was nothing to be seen, and it was absolutely quiet down there. Then we heard Halsey running up the main staircase. He came quickly down the hall to where we were standing.  “There’s no one trying to get in. I thought I heard some one shriek. Who was it?”  Our stricken faces told him the truth.  “Some one screamed down there,” I said. “And—and Louise is not in her room.”  With a jerk Halsey took the light from Liddy and ran down the circular staircase. I followed him, more slowly. My nerves seemed to be in a state of paralysis: I could scarcely step. At the foot of the stairs Halsey gave an exclamation and put down the light.  “Aunt Ray,” he called sharply.  At the foot of the staircase, huddled in a heap, her head on the lower stair, was Louise Armstrong. She lay limp and white, her dressing-gown dragging loose from one sleeve of her night-dress, and the heavy braid of her dark hair stretching its length a couple of steps above her head, as if she had slipped down.  She was not dead: Halsey put her down on the floor, and began to rub her cold hands, while Gertrude and Liddy ran for stimulants. As for me, I sat there at the foot of that ghostly staircase—sat, because my knees wouldn’t hold me—and wondered where it would all end. Louise was still unconscious, but she was breathing better, and I suggested that we get her back to bed before she came to. There was something grisly and horrible to me, seeing her there in almost the same attitude and in the same place where we had found her brother’s body. And to add to the similarity, just then the hall clock, far off, struck faintly three o’clock.  It was four before Louise was able to talk, and the first rays of dawn were coming through her windows, which faced the east, before she could tell us coherently what had occurred. I give it as she told it. She lay propped in bed, and Halsey sat beside her, unrebuffed, and held her hand while she talked.  “I was not sleeping well,” she began, “partly, I think, because I had slept during the afternoon. Liddy brought me some hot milk at ten o’clock and I slept until twelve. Then I wakened and—I got to thinking about things, and worrying, so I could not go to sleep.  “I was wondering why I had not heard from Arnold since the—since I saw him that night at the lodge. I was afraid he was ill, because—he was to have done something for me, and he had not come back. It must have been three when I heard some one rapping. I sat up and listened, to be quite sure, and the rapping kept up. It was cautious, and I was about to call Liddy.  “Then suddenly I thought I knew what it was. The east entrance and the circular staircase were always used by Arnold when he was out late, and sometimes, when he forgot his key, he would rap and I would go down and let him in. I thought he had come back to see me—I didn’t think about the time, for his hours were always erratic. But I was afraid I was too weak to get down the stairs.  “The knocking kept up, and just as I was about to call Liddy, she ran through the room and out into the hall. I got up then, feeling weak and dizzy, and put on my dressing-gown. If it was Arnold, I knew I must see him.  “It was very dark everywhere, but, of course, I knew my way. I felt along for the stair-rail, and went down as quickly as I could. The knocking had stopped, and I was afraid I was too late. I got to the foot of the staircase and over to the door on to the east veranda. I had never thought of anything but that it was Arnold, until I reached the door. It was unlocked and opened about an inch. Everything was black: it was perfectly dark outside. I felt very queer and shaky. Then I thought perhaps Arnold had used his key; he did—strange things sometimes, and I turned around. Just as I reached the foot of the staircase I thought I heard some one coming. My nerves were going anyhow, there in the dark, and I could scarcely stand. I got up as far as the third or fourth step; then I felt that some one was coming toward me on the staircase. The next instant a hand met mine on the stair-rail. Some one brushed past me, and I screamed. Then I must have fainted.”  That was Louise’s story. There could be no doubt of its truth, and the thing that made it inexpressibly awful to me was that the poor girl had crept down to answer the summons of a brother who would never need her kindly offices again. Twice now, without apparent cause, some one had entered the house by means of the east entrance: had apparently gone his way unhindered through the house, and gone out again as he had entered. Had this unknown visitor been there a third time, the night Arnold Armstrong was murdered? Or a fourth, the time Mr. Jamieson had locked some one in the clothes chute?  Sleep was impossible, I think, for any of us. We dispersed finally to bathe and dress, leaving Louise little the worse for her experience. But I determined that before the day was over she must know the true state of affairs. Another decision I made, and I put it into execution immediately after breakfast. I had one of the unused bedrooms in the east wing, back along the small corridor, prepared for occupancy, and from that time on, Alex, the gardener, slept there. One man in that barn of a house was an absurdity, with things happening all the time, and I must say that Alex was as unobjectionable as any one could possibly have been.  The next morning, also, Halsey and I made an exhaustive examination of the circular staircase, the small entry at its foot, and the card-room opening from it. There was no evidence of anything unusual the night before, and had we not ourselves heard the rapping noises, I should have felt that Louise’s imagination had run away with her. The outer door was closed and locked, and the staircase curved above us, for all the world like any other staircase.  Halsey, who had never taken seriously my account of the night Liddy and I were there alone, was grave enough now. He examined the paneling of the wainscoting above and below the stairs, evidently looking for a secret door, and suddenly there flashed into my mind the recollection of a scrap of paper that Mr. Jamieson had found among Arnold Armstrong’s effects. As nearly as possible I repeated its contents to him, while Halsey took them down in a note-book.  “I wish you had told me that before,” he said, as he put the memorandum carefully away. We found nothing at all in the house, and I expected little from any examination of the porch and grounds. But as we opened the outer door something fell into the entry with a clatter. It was a cue from the billiard-room.  Halsey picked it up with an exclamation.  “That’s careless enough,” he said. “Some of the servants have been amusing themselves.”  I was far from convinced. Not one of the servants would go into that wing at night unless driven by dire necessity. And a billiard cue! As a weapon of either offense or defense it was an absurdity, unless one accepted Liddy’s hypothesis of a ghost, and even then, as Halsey pointed out, a billiard-playing ghost would be a very modern evolution of an ancient institution.  That afternoon we, Gertrude, Halsey and I, attended the coroner’s inquest in town. Doctor Stewart had been summoned also, it transpiring that in that early Sunday morning, when Gertrude and I had gone to our rooms, he had been called to view the body. We went, the four of us, in the machine, preferring the execrable roads to the matinee train, with half of Casanova staring at us. And on the way we decided to say nothing of Louise and her interview with her stepbrother the night he died. The girl was in trouble enough as it was.     CHAPTER XVII. A HINT OF SCANDAL   In giving the gist of what happened at the inquest, I have only one excuse—to recall to the reader the events of the night of Arnold Armstrong’s murder. Many things had occurred which were not brought out at the inquest and some things were told there that were new to me. Altogether, it was a gloomy affair, and the six men in the corner, who constituted the coroner’s jury, were evidently the merest puppets in the hands of that all-powerful gentleman, the coroner.  Gertrude and I sat well back, with our veils down. There were a number of people I knew: Barbara Fitzhugh, in extravagant mourning—she always went into black on the slightest provocation, because it was becoming—and Mr. Jarvis, the man who had come over from the Greenwood Club the night of the murder. Mr. Harton was there, too, looking impatient as the inquest dragged, but alive to every particle of evidence. From a corner Mr. Jamieson was watching the proceedings intently.  Doctor Stewart was called first. His evidence was told briefly, and amounted to this: on the Sunday morning previous, at a quarter before five, he had been called to the telephone. The message was from a Mr. Jarvis, who asked him to come at once to Sunnyside, as there had been an accident there, and Mr. Arnold Armstrong had been shot. He had dressed hastily, gathered up some instruments, and driven to Sunnyside.  He was met by Mr. Jarvis, who took him at once to the east wing. There, just as he had fallen, was the body of Arnold Armstrong. There was no need of the instruments: the man was dead. In answer to the coroner’s question—no, the body had not been moved, save to turn it over. It lay at the foot of the circular staircase. Yes, he believed death had been instantaneous. The body was still somewhat warm and rigor mortis had not set in. It occurred late in cases of sudden death. No, he believed the probability of suicide might be eliminated; the wounds could have been self-inflicted, but with difficulty, and there had been no weapon found.  The doctor’s examination was over, but he hesitated and cleared his throat.  “Mr. Coroner,” he said, “at the risk of taking up valuable time, I would like to speak of an incident that may or may not throw some light on this matter.”  The audience was alert at once.  “Kindly proceed, Doctor,” the coroner said.  “My home is in Englewood, two miles from Casanova,” the doctor began. “In the absence of Doctor Walker, a number of Casanova people have been consulting me. A month ago—five weeks, to be exact—a woman whom I had never seen came to my office. She was in deep mourning and kept her veil down, and she brought for examination a child, a boy of six. The little fellow was ill; it looked like typhoid, and the mother was frantic. She wanted a permit to admit the youngster to the Children’s Hospital in town here, where I am a member of the staff, and I gave her one. The incident would have escaped me, but for a curious thing. Two days before Mr. Armstrong was shot, I was sent for to go to the Country Club: some one had been struck with a golf-ball that had gone wild. It was late when I left—I was on foot, and about a mile from the club, on the Claysburg road, I met two people. They were disputing violently, and I had no difficulty in recognizing Mr. Armstrong. The woman, beyond doubt, was the one who had consulted me about the child.”  At this hint of scandal, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh sat up very straight. Jamieson was looking slightly skeptical, and the coroner made a note.  “The Children’s Hospital, you say, Doctor?” he asked.  “Yes. But the child, who was entered as Lucien Wallace, was taken away by his mother two weeks ago. I have tried to trace them and failed.”  All at once I remembered the telegram sent to Louise by some one signed F. L. W.—presumably Doctor Walker. Could this veiled woman be the Nina Carrington of the message? But it was only idle speculation. I had no way of finding out, and the inquest was proceeding.  The report of the coroner’s physician came next. The post-mortem examination showed that the bullet had entered the chest in the fourth left intercostal space and had taken an oblique course downward and backward, piercing both the heart and lungs. The left lung was collapsed, and the exit point of the ball had been found in the muscles of the back to the left of the spinal column. It was improbable that such a wound had been self-inflicted, and its oblique downward course pointed to the fact that the shot had been fired from above. In other words, as the murdered man had been found dead at the foot of a staircase, it was probable that the shot had been fired by some one higher up on the stairs. There were no marks of powder. The bullet, a thirty-eight caliber, had been found in the dead man’s clothing, and was shown to the jury.  Mr. Jarvis was called next, but his testimony amounted to little.  He had been summoned by telephone to Sunnyside, had come over at once with the steward and Mr. Winthrop, at present out of town. They had been admitted by the housekeeper, and had found the body lying at the foot of the staircase. He had made a search for a weapon, but there was none around. The outer entry door in the east wing had been unfastened and was open about an inch.  I had been growing more and more nervous. When the coroner called Mr. John Bailey, the room was filled with suppressed excitement. Mr. Jamieson went forward and spoke a few words to the coroner, who nodded. Then Halsey was called.  “Mr. Innes,” the coroner said, “will you tell under what circumstances you saw Mr. Arnold Armstrong the night he died?”  “I saw him first at the Country Club,” Halsey said quietly. He was rather pale, but very composed. “I stopped there with my automobile for gasolene. Mr. Armstrong had been playing cards. When I saw him there, he was coming out of the card-room, talking to Mr. John Bailey.”  “The nature of the discussion—was it amicable?”  Halsey hesitated.  “They were having a dispute,” he said. “I asked Mr. Bailey to leave the club with me and come to Sunnyside over Sunday.”  “Isn’t it a fact, Mr. Innes, that you took Mr. Bailey away from the club-house because you were afraid there would be blows?”  “The situation was unpleasant,” Halsey said evasively.  “At that time had you any suspicion that the Traders’ Bank had been wrecked?”  “No.”  “What occurred next?”  “Mr. Bailey and I talked in the billiard-room until two-thirty.”  “And Mr. Arnold Armstrong came there, while you were talking?”  “Yes. He came about half-past two. He rapped at the east door, and I admitted him.”  The silence in the room was intense. Mr. Jamieson’s eyes never left Halsey’s face.  “Will you tell us the nature of his errand?”  “He brought a telegram that had come to the club for Mr. Bailey.”  “He was sober?”  “Perfectly, at that time. Not earlier.”  “Was not his apparent friendliness a change from his former attitude?”  “Yes. I did not understand it.”  “How long did he stay?”  “About five minutes. Then he left, by the east entrance.”  “What occurred then?”  “We talked for a few minutes, discussing a plan Mr. Bailey had in mind. Then I went to the stables, where I kept my car, and got it out.”  “Leaving Mr. Bailey alone in the billiard-room?”  Halsey hesitated.  “My sister was there.”  Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh had the courage to turn and eye Gertrude through her lorgnon.  “And then?”  “I took the car along the lower road, not to disturb the household. Mr. Bailey came down across the lawn, through the hedge, and got into the car on the road.”  “Then you know nothing of Mr. Armstrong’s movements after he left the house?”  “Nothing. I read of his death Monday evening for the first time.”  “Mr. Bailey did not see him on his way across the lawn?”  “I think not. If he had seen him he would have spoken of it.”  “Thank you. That is all. Miss Gertrude Innes.”  Gertrude’s replies were fully as concise as Halsey’s. Mrs. Fitzhugh subjected her to a close inspection, commencing with her hat and ending with her shoes. I flatter myself she found nothing wrong with either her gown or her manner, but poor Gertrude’s testimony was the reverse of comforting. She had been summoned, she said, by her brother, after Mr. Armstrong had gone.  She had waited in the billiard-room with Mr. Bailey, until the automobile had been ready. Then she had locked the door at the foot of the staircase, and, taking a lamp, had accompanied Mr. Bailey to the main entrance of the house, and had watched him cross the lawn. Instead of going at once to her room, she had gone back to the billiard-room for something which had been left there. The card-room and billiard-room were in darkness. She had groped around, found the article she was looking for, and was on the point of returning to her room, when she had heard some one fumbling at the lock at the east outer door. She had thought it was probably her brother, and had been about to go to the door, when she heard it open. Almost immediately there was a shot, and she had run panic-stricken through the drawing-room and had roused the house.  “You heard no other sound?” the coroner asked. “There was no one with Mr. Armstrong when he entered?”  “It was perfectly dark. There were no voices and I heard nothing. There was just the opening of the door, the shot, and the sound of somebody falling.”  “Then, while you went through the drawing-room and up-stairs to alarm the household, the criminal, whoever it was, could have escaped by the east door?”  “Yes.”  “Thank you. That will do.”  I flatter myself that the coroner got little enough out of me. I saw Mr. Jamieson smiling to himself, and the coroner gave me up, after a time. I admitted I had found the body, said I had not known who it was until Mr. Jarvis told me, and ended by looking up at Barbara Fitzhugh and saying that in renting the house I had not expected to be involved in any family scandal. At which she turned purple.  The verdict was that Arnold Armstrong had met his death at the hands of a person or persons unknown, and we all prepared to leave. Barbara Fitzhugh flounced out without waiting to speak to me, but Mr. Harton came up, as I knew he would.  “You have decided to give up the house, I hope, Miss Innes,” he said. “Mrs. Armstrong has wired me again.”  “I am not going to give it up,” I maintained, “until I understand some things that are puzzling me. The day that the murderer is discovered, I will leave.”  “Then, judging by what I have heard, you will be back in the city very soon,” he said. And I knew that he suspected the discredited cashier of the Traders’ Bank.  Mr. Jamieson came up to me as I was about to leave the coroner’s office.  “How is your patient?” he asked with his odd little smile.  “I have no patient,” I replied, startled.  “I will put it in a different way, then. How is Miss Armstrong?”  “She—she is doing very well,” I stammered.  “Good,” cheerfully. “And our ghost? Is it laid?”  “Mr. Jamieson,” I said suddenly, “I wish you would do one thing: I wish you would come to Sunnyside and spend a few days there. The ghost is not laid. I want you to spend one night at least watching the circular staircase. The murder of Arnold Armstrong was a beginning, not an end.”  He looked serious.  “Perhaps I can do it,” he said. “I have been doing something else, but—well, I will come out to-night.”  We were very silent during the trip back to Sunnyside. I watched Gertrude closely and somewhat sadly. To me there was one glaring flaw in her story, and it seemed to stand out for every one to see. Arnold Armstrong had had no key, and yet she said she had locked the east door. He must have been admitted from within the house; over and over I repeated it to myself.  That night, as gently as I could, I told Louise the story of her stepbrother’s death. She sat in her big, pillow-filled chair, and heard me through without interruption. It was clear that she was shocked beyond words: if I had hoped to learn anything from her expression, I had failed. She was as much in the dark as we were.     CHAPTER XVIII. A HOLE IN THE WALL   My taking the detective out to Sunnyside raised an unexpected storm of protest from Gertrude and Halsey. I was not prepared for it, and I scarcely knew how to account for it. To me Mr. Jamieson was far less formidable under my eyes where I knew what he was doing, than he was off in the city, twisting circumstances and motives to suit himself and learning what he wished to know, about events at Sunnyside, in some occult way. I was glad enough to have him there, when excitements began to come thick and fast.  A new element was about to enter into affairs: Monday, or Tuesday at the latest, would find Doctor Walker back in his green and white house in the village, and Louise’s attitude to him in the immediate future would signify Halsey’s happiness or wretchedness, as it might turn out. Then, too, the return of her mother would mean, of course, that she would have to leave us, and I had become greatly attached to her.  From the day Mr. Jamieson came to Sunnyside there was a subtle change in Gertrude’s manner to me. It was elusive, difficult to analyze, but it was there. She was no longer frank with me, although I think her affection never wavered. At the time I laid the change to the fact that I had forbidden all communication with John Bailey, and had refused to acknowledge any engagement between the two. Gertrude spent much of her time wandering through the grounds, or taking long cross-country walks. Halsey played golf at the Country Club day after day, and after Louise left, as she did the following week, Mr. Jamieson and I were much together. He played a fair game of cribbage, but he cheated at solitaire.  The night the detective arrived, Saturday, I had a talk with him.  I told him of the experience Louise Armstrong had had the night before, on the circular staircase, and about the man who had so frightened Rosie on the drive. I saw that he thought the information was important, and to my suggestion that we put an additional lock on the east wing door he opposed a strong negative.  “I think it probable,” he said, “that our visitor will be back again, and the thing to do is to leave things exactly as they are, to avoid rousing suspicion. Then I can watch for at least a part of each night and probably Mr. Innes will help us out. I would say as little to Thomas as possible. The old man knows more than he is willing to admit.”  I suggested that Alex, the gardener, would probably be willing to help, and Mr. Jamieson undertook to make the arrangement. For one night, however, Mr. Jamieson preferred to watch alone. Apparently nothing occurred. The detective sat in absolute darkness on the lower step of the stairs, dozing, he said afterwards, now and then. Nothing could pass him in either direction, and the door in the morning remained as securely fastened as it had been the night before. And yet one of the most inexplicable occurrences of the whole affair took place that very night.  Liddy came to my room on Sunday morning with a face as long as the moral law. She laid out my things as usual, but I missed her customary garrulousness. I was not regaled with the new cook’s extravagance as to eggs, and she even forbore to mention “that Jamieson,” on whose arrival she had looked with silent disfavor.  “What’s the matter, Liddy?” I asked at last. “Didn’t you sleep last night?”  “No, ma’m,” she said stiffly.  “Did you have two cups of coffee at your dinner?” I inquired.  “No, ma’m,” indignantly.  I sat up and almost upset my hot water—I always take a cup of hot water with a pinch of salt, before I get up. It tones the stomach.  “Liddy Allen,” I said, “stop combing that switch and tell me what is wrong with you.”  Liddy heaved a sigh.  “Girl and woman,” she said, “I’ve been with you twenty-five years, Miss Rachel, through good temper and bad—” the idea! and what I have taken from her in the way of sulks!—“but I guess I can’t stand it any longer. My trunk’s packed.”  “Who packed it?” I asked, expecting from her tone to be told she had wakened to find it done by some ghostly hand.  “I did; Miss Rachel, you won’t believe me when I tell you this house is haunted. Who was it fell down the clothes chute? Who was it scared Miss Louise almost into her grave?”  “I’m doing my best to find out,” I said. “What in the world are you driving at?” She drew a long breath.  “There is a hole in the trunk-room wall, dug out since last night. It’s big enough to put your head in, and the plaster’s all over the place.”  “Nonsense!” I said. “Plaster is always falling.”  But Liddy clenched that.  “Just ask Alex,” she said. “When he put the new cook’s trunk there last night the wall was as smooth as this. This morning it’s dug out, and there’s plaster on the cook’s trunk. Miss Rachel, you can get a dozen detectives and put one on every stair in the house, and you’ll never catch anything. There’s some things you can’t handcuff.”  Liddy was right. As soon as I could, I went up to the trunk-room, which was directly over my bedroom. The plan of the upper story of the house was like that of the second floor, in the main. One end, however, over the east wing, had been left only roughly finished, the intention having been to convert it into a ball-room at some future time. The maids’ rooms, trunk-room, and various store-rooms, including a large airy linen-room, opened from a long corridor, like that on the second floor. And in the trunk-room, as Liddy had said, was a fresh break in the plaster.  Not only in the plaster, but through the lathing, the aperture extended. I reached into the opening, and three feet away, perhaps, I could touch the bricks of the partition wall. For some reason, the architect, in building the house, had left a space there that struck me, even in the surprise of the discovery, as an excellent place for a conflagration to gain headway.  “You are sure the hole was not here yesterday?” I asked Liddy, whose expression was a mixture of satisfaction and alarm. In answer she pointed to the new cook’s trunk—that necessary adjunct of the migratory domestic. The top was covered with fine white plaster, as was the floor. But there were no large pieces of mortar lying around—no bits of lathing. When I mentioned this to Liddy she merely raised her eyebrows. Being quite confident that the gap was of unholy origin, she did not concern herself with such trifles as a bit of mortar and lath. No doubt they were even then heaped neatly on a gravestone in the Casanova churchyard!  I brought Mr. Jamieson up to see the hole in the wall, directly after breakfast. His expression was very odd when he looked at it, and the first thing he did was to try to discover what object, if any, such a hole could have. He got a piece of candle, and by enlarging the aperture a little was able to examine what lay beyond. The result was _nil_. The trunk-room, although heated by steam heat, like the rest of the house, boasted of a fireplace and mantel as well. The opening had been made between the flue and the outer wall of the house. There was revealed, however, on inspection, only the brick of the chimney on one side and the outer wall of the house on the other; in depth the space extended only to the flooring. The breach had been made about four feet from the floor, and inside were all the missing bits of plaster. It had been a methodical ghost.  It was very much of a disappointment. I had expected a secret room, at the very least, and I think even Mr. Jamieson had fancied he might at last have a clue to the mystery. There was evidently nothing more to be discovered: Liddy reported that everything was serene among the servants, and that none of them had been disturbed by the noise. The maddening thing, however, was that the nightly visitor had evidently more than one way of gaining access to the house, and we made arrangements to redouble our vigilance as to windows and doors that night.  Halsey was inclined to pooh-pooh the whole affair. He said a break in the plaster might have occurred months ago and gone unnoticed, and that the dust had probably been stirred up the day before. After all, we had to let it go at that, but we put in an uncomfortable Sunday. Gertrude went to church, and Halsey took a long walk in the morning. Louise was able to sit up, and she allowed Halsey and Liddy to assist her down-stairs late in the afternoon. The east veranda was shady, green with vines and palms, cheerful with cushions and lounging chairs. We put Louise in a steamer chair, and she sat there passively enough, her hands clasped in her lap.  We were very silent. Halsey sat on the rail with a pipe, openly watching Louise, as she looked broodingly across the valley to the hills. There was something baffling in the girl’s eyes; and gradually Halsey’s boyish features lost their glow at seeing her about again, and settled into grim lines. He was like his father just then.  We sat until late afternoon, Halsey growing more and more moody. Shortly before six, he got up and went into the house, and in a few minutes he came out and called me to the telephone. It was Anna Whitcomb, in town, and she kept me for twenty minutes, telling me the children had had the measles, and how Madame Sweeny had botched her new gown.  When I finished, Liddy was behind me, her mouth a thin line.  “I wish you would try to look cheerful, Liddy,” I groaned, “your face would sour milk.” But Liddy seldom replied to my gibes. She folded her lips a little tighter.  “He called her up,” she said oracularly, “he called her up, and asked her to keep you at the telephone, so he could talk to Miss Louise. _A thankless child is sharper than a serpent’s tooth_”  “Nonsense!” I said bruskly. “I might have known enough to leave them. It’s a long time since you and I were in love, Liddy, and—we forget.”  Liddy sniffed.  “No man ever made a fool of me,” she replied virtuously.  “Well, something did,” I retorted.     CHAPTER XIX. CONCERNING THOMAS   “Mr. Jamieson,” I said, when we found ourselves alone after dinner that night, “the inquest yesterday seemed to me the merest recapitulation of things that were already known. It developed nothing new beyond the story of Doctor Stewart’s, and that was volunteered.”  “An inquest is only a necessary formality, Miss Innes,” he replied. “Unless a crime is committed in the open, the inquest does nothing beyond getting evidence from witnesses while events are still in their minds. The police step in later. You and I both know how many important things never transpired. For instance: the dead man had no key, and yet Miss Gertrude testified to a fumbling at the lock, and then the opening of the door. The piece of evidence you mention, Doctor Stewart’s story, is one of those things we have to take cautiously: the doctor has a patient who wears black and does not raise her veil. Why, it is the typical mysterious lady! Then the good doctor comes across Arnold Armstrong, who was a graceless scamp—_de mortuis_—what’s the rest of it?—and he is quarreling with a lady in black. Behold, says the doctor, they are one and the same.”  “Why was Mr. Bailey not present at the inquest?”  The detective’s expression was peculiar.  “Because his physician testified that he is ill, and unable to leave his bed.”  “Ill!” I exclaimed. “Why, neither Halsey nor Gertrude has told me that.”  “There are more things than that, Miss Innes, that are puzzling. Bailey gives the impression that he knew nothing of the crash at the bank until he read it in the paper Monday night, and that he went back and surrendered himself immediately. I do not believe it. Jonas, the watchman at the Traders’ Bank, tells a different story. He says that on the Thursday night before, about eight-thirty, Bailey went back to the bank. Jonas admitted him, and he says the cashier was in a state almost of collapse. Bailey worked until midnight, then he closed the vault and went away. The occurrence was so unusual that the watchman pondered over it an the rest of the night. What did Bailey do when he went back to the Knickerbocker apartments that night? He packed a suit-case ready for instant departure. But he held off too long; he waited for something. My personal opinion is that he waited to see Miss Gertrude before flying from the country. Then, when he had shot down Arnold Armstrong that night, he had to choose between two evils. He did the thing that would immediately turn public opinion in his favor, and surrendered himself, as an innocent man. The strongest thing against him is his preparation for flight, and his deciding to come back after the murder of Arnold Armstrong. He was shrewd enough to disarm suspicion as to the graver charge.”  The evening dragged along slowly. Mrs. Watson came to my bedroom before I went to bed and asked if I had any arnica. She showed me a badly swollen hand, with reddish streaks running toward the elbow; she said it was the hand she had hurt the night of the murder a week before, and that she had not slept well since. It looked to me as if it might be serious, and I told her to let Doctor Stewart see it.  The next morning Mrs. Watson went up to town on the eleven train, and was admitted to the Charity Hospital. She was suffering from blood-poisoning. I fully meant to go up and see her there, but other things drove her entirely from my mind. I telephoned to the hospital that day, however, and ordered a private room for her, and whatever comforts she might be allowed.  Mrs. Armstrong arrived Monday evening with her husband’s body, and the services were set for the next day. The house on Chestnut Street, in town, had been opened, and Tuesday morning Louise left us to go home. She sent for me before she went, and I saw she had been crying.  “How can I thank you, Miss Innes?” she said. “You have taken me on faith, and—you have not asked me any questions. Some time, perhaps, I can tell you; and when that time comes, you will all despise me,—Halsey, too.”  I tried to tell her how glad I was to have had her but there was something else she wanted to say. She said it finally, when she had bade a constrained good-by to Halsey and the car was waiting at the door.  “Miss Innes,” she said in a low tone, “if they—if there is any attempt made to—to have you give up the house, do it, if you possibly can. I am afraid—to have you stay.”  That was all. Gertrude went into town with her and saw her safely home. She reported a decided coolness in the greeting between Louise and her mother, and that Doctor Walker was there, apparently in charge of the arrangements for the funeral. Halsey disappeared shortly after Louise left and came home about nine that night, muddy and tired. As for Thomas, he went around dejected and sad, and I saw the detective watching him closely at dinner. Even now I wonder—what did Thomas know? What did he suspect?  At ten o’clock the household had settled down for the night. Liddy, who was taking Mrs. Watson’s place, had finished examining the tea-towels and the corners of the shelves in the cooling-room, and had gone to bed. Alex, the gardener, had gone heavily up the circular staircase to his room, and Mr. Jamieson was examining the locks of the windows. Halsey dropped into a chair in the living-room, and stared moodily ahead. Once he roused.  “What sort of a looking chap is that Walker, Gertrude?” he asked!  “Rather tall, very dark, smooth-shaven. Not bad looking,” Gertrude said, putting down the book she had been pretending to read. Halsey kicked a taboret viciously.  “Lovely place this village must be in the winter,” he said irrelevantly. “A girl would be buried alive here.”  It was then some one rapped at the knocker on the heavy front door. Halsey got up leisurely and opened it, admitting Warner. He was out of breath from running, and he looked half abashed.  “I am sorry to disturb you,” he said. “But I didn’t know what else to do. It’s about Thomas.”  “What about Thomas?” I asked. Mr. Jamieson had come into the hall and we all stared at Warner.  “He’s acting queer,” Warner explained. “He’s sitting down there on the edge of the porch, and he says he has seen a ghost. The old man looks bad, too; he can scarcely speak.”  “He’s as full of superstition as an egg is of meat,” I said. “Halsey, bring some whisky and we will all go down.”  No one moved to get the whisky, from which I judged there were three pocket flasks ready for emergency. Gertrude threw a shawl around my shoulders, and we all started down over the hill: I had made so many nocturnal excursions around the place that I knew my way perfectly. But Thomas was not on the veranda, nor was he inside the house. The men exchanged significant glances, and Warner got a lantern.  “He can’t have gone far,” he said. “He was trembling so that he couldn’t stand, when I left.”  Jamieson and Halsey together made the round of the lodge, occasionally calling the old man by name. But there was no response. No Thomas came, bowing and showing his white teeth through the darkness. I began to be vaguely uneasy, for the first time. Gertrude, who was never nervous in the dark, went alone down the drive to the gate, and stood there, looking along the yellowish line of the road, while I waited on the tiny veranda.  Warner was puzzled. He came around to the edge of the veranda and stood looking at it as if it ought to know and explain.  “He might have stumbled into the house,” he said, “but he could not have climbed the stairs. Anyhow, he’s not inside or outside, that I can see.” The other members of the party had come back now, and no one had found any trace of the old man. His pipe, still warm, rested on the edge of the rail, and inside on the table his old gray hat showed that its owner had not gone far.  He was not far, after all. From the table my eyes traveled around the room, and stopped at the door of a closet. I hardly know what impulse moved me, but I went in and turned the knob. It burst open with the impetus of a weight behind it, and something fell partly forward in a heap on the floor. It was Thomas—Thomas without a mark of injury on him, and dead.     CHAPTER XX. DOCTOR WALKER’S WARNING   Warner was on his knees in a moment, fumbling at the old man’s collar to loosen it, but Halsey caught his hand.  “Let him alone,” he said. “You can’t help him; he is dead.”  We stood there, each avoiding the other’s eyes; we spoke low and reverently in the presence of death, and we tacitly avoided any mention of the suspicion that was in every mind. When Mr. Jamieson had finished his cursory examination, he got up and dusted the knees of his trousers.  “There is no sign of injury,” he said, and I know I, for one, drew a long breath of relief. “From what Warner says and from his hiding in the closet, I should say he was scared to death. Fright and a weak heart, together.”  “But what could have done it?” Gertrude asked. “He was all right this evening at dinner. Warner, what did he say when you found him on the porch?”  Warner looked shaken: his honest, boyish face was colorless.  “Just what I told you, Miss Innes. He’d been reading the paper down-stairs; I had put up the car, and, feeling sleepy, I came down to the lodge to go to bed. As I went up-stairs, Thomas put down the paper and, taking his pipe, went out on the porch. Then I heard an exclamation from him.”  “What did he say?” demanded Jamieson.  “I couldn’t hear, but his voice was strange; it sounded startled. I waited for him to call out again, but he did not, so I went down-stairs. He was sitting on the porch step, looking straight ahead, as if he saw something among the trees across the road. And he kept mumbling about having seen a ghost. He looked queer, and I tried to get him inside, but he wouldn’t move. Then I thought I’d better go up to the house.”  “Didn’t he say anything else you could understand?” I asked.  “He said something about the grave giving up its dead.”  Mr. Jamieson was going through the old man’s pockets, and Gertrude was composing his arms, folding them across his white shirt-bosom, always so spotless.  Mr. Jamieson looked up at me.  “What was that you said to me, Miss Innes, about the murder at the house being a beginning and not an end? By jove, I believe you were right!”  In the course of his investigations the detective had come to the inner pocket of the dead butler’s black coat. Here he found some things that interested him. One was a small flat key, with a red cord tied to it, and the other was a bit of white paper, on which was written something in Thomas’ cramped hand. Mr. Jamieson read it: then he gave it to me. It was an address in fresh ink—  LUCIEN WALLACE, 14 Elm Street, Richfield.   As the card went around, I think both the detective and I watched for any possible effect it might have, but, beyond perplexity, there seemed to be none.  “Richfield!” Gertrude exclaimed. “Why, Elm Street is the main street; don’t you remember, Halsey?”  “Lucien Wallace!” Halsey said. “That is the child Stewart spoke of at the inquest.”  Warner, with his mechanic’s instinct, had reached for the key. What he said was not a surprise.  “Yale lock,” he said. “Probably a key to the east entry.”  There was no reason why Thomas, an old and trusted servant, should not have had a key to that particular door, although the servants’ entry was in the west wing. But I had not known of this key, and it opened up a new field of conjecture. Just now, however, there were many things to be attended to, and, leaving Warner with the body, we all went back to the house. Mr. Jamieson walked with me, while Halsey and Gertrude followed.  “I suppose I shall have to notify the Armstrongs,” I said. “They will know if Thomas had any people and how to reach them. Of course, I expect to defray the expenses of the funeral, but his relatives must be found. What do you think frightened him, Mr. Jamieson?”  “It is hard to say,” he replied slowly, “but I think we may be certain it was fright, and that he was hiding from something. I am sorry in more than one way: I have always believed that Thomas knew something, or suspected something, that he would not tell. Do you know how much money there was in that worn-out wallet of his? Nearly a hundred dollars! Almost two months’ wages—and yet those darkies seldom have a penny. Well—what Thomas knew will be buried with him.”  Halsey suggested that the grounds be searched, but Mr. Jamieson vetoed the suggestion.  “You would find nothing,” he said. “A person clever enough to get into Sunnyside and tear a hole in the wall, while I watched down-stairs, is not to be found by going around the shrubbery with a lantern.”  With the death of Thomas, I felt that a climax had come in affairs at Sunnyside. The night that followed was quiet enough. Halsey watched at the foot of the staircase, and a complicated system of bolts on the other doors seemed to be effectual.  Once in the night I wakened and thought I heard the tapping again. But all was quiet, and I had reached the stage where I refused to be disturbed for minor occurrences.  The Armstrongs were notified of Thomas’ death, and I had my first interview with Doctor Walker as a result. He came up early the next morning, just as we finished breakfast, in a professional looking car with a black hood. I found him striding up and down the living-room, and, in spite of my preconceived dislike, I had to admit that the man was presentable. A big fellow he was, tall and dark, as Gertrude had said, smooth-shaven and erect, with prominent features and a square jaw. He was painfully spruce in his appearance, and his manner was almost obtrusively polite.  “I must make a double excuse for this early visit, Miss Innes,” he said as he sat down. The chair was lower than he expected, and his dignity required collecting before he went on. “My professional duties are urgent and long neglected, and”—a fall to the every-day manner—“something must be done about that body.”  “Yes,” I said, sitting on the edge of my chair. “I merely wished the address of Thomas’ people. You might have telephoned, if you were busy.”  He smiled.  “I wished to see you about something else,” he said. “As for Thomas, it is Mrs. Armstrong’s wish that you would allow her to attend to the expense. About his relatives, I have already notified his brother, in the village. It was heart disease, I think. Thomas always had a bad heart.”  “Heart disease and fright,” I said, still on the edge of my chair. But the doctor had no intention of leaving.  “I understand you have a ghost up here, and that you have the house filled with detectives to exorcise it,” he said.  For some reason I felt I was being “pumped,” as Halsey says. “You have been misinformed,” I replied.  “What, no ghost, no detectives!” he said, still with his smile. “What a disappointment to the village!”  I resented his attempt at playfulness. It had been anything but a joke to us.  “Doctor Walker,” I said tartly, “I fail to see any humor in the situation. Since I came here, one man has been shot, and another one has died from shock. There have been intruders in the house, and strange noises. If that is funny, there is something wrong with my sense of humor.”  “You miss the point,” he said, still good-naturedly. “The thing that is funny, to me, is that you insist on remaining here, under the circumstances. I should think nothing would keep you.”  “You are mistaken. Everything that occurs only confirms my resolution to stay until the mystery is cleared.”  “I have a message for you, Miss Innes,” he said, rising at last. “Mrs. Armstrong asked me to thank you for your kindness to Louise, whose whim, occurring at the time it did, put her to great inconvenience. Also—and this is a delicate matter—she asked me to appeal to your natural sympathy for her, at this time, and to ask you if you will not reconsider your decision about the house. Sunnyside is her home; she loves it dearly, and just now she wishes to retire here for quiet and peace.”  “She must have had a change of heart,” I said, ungraciously enough. “Louise told me her mother despised the place. Besides, this is no place for quiet and peace just now. Anyhow, doctor, while I don’t care to force an issue, I shall certainly remain here, for a time at least.”  “For how long?” he asked.  “My lease is for six months. I shall stay until some explanation is found for certain things. My own family is implicated now, and I shall do everything to clear the mystery of Arnold Armstrong’s murder.”  The doctor stood looking down, slapping his gloves thoughtfully against the palm of a well-looked-after hand.  “You say there have been intruders in the house?” he asked. “You are sure of that, Miss Innes?”  “Certain.”  “In what part?”  “In the east wing.”  “Can you tell me when these intrusions occurred, and what the purpose seemed to be? Was it robbery?”  “No,” I said decidedly. “As to time, once on Friday night a week ago, again the following night, when Arnold Armstrong was murdered, and again last Friday night.”  The doctor looked serious. He seemed to be debating some question in his mind, and to reach a decision.  “Miss Innes,” he said, “I am in a peculiar position; I understand your attitude, of course; but—do you think you are wise? Ever since you have come here there have been hostile demonstrations against you and your family. I’m not a croaker, but—take a warning. Leave before anything occurs that will cause you a lifelong regret.”  “I am willing to take the responsibility,” I said coldly.  I think he gave me up then as a poor proposition. He asked to be shown where Arnold Armstrong’s body had been found, and I took him there. He scrutinized the whole place carefully, examining the stairs and the lock. When he had taken a formal farewell I was confident of one thing. Doctor Walker would do anything he could to get me away from Sunnyside.     CHAPTER XXI. FOURTEEN ELM STREET   It was Monday evening when we found the body of poor old Thomas. Monday night had been uneventful; things were quiet at the house and the peculiar circumstances of the old man’s death had been carefully kept from the servants. Rosie took charge of the dining-room and pantry, in the absence of a butler, and, except for the warning of the Casanova doctor, everything breathed of peace.  Affairs at the Traders’ Bank were progressing slowly. The failure had hit small stock-holders very hard, the minister of the little Methodist chapel in Casanova among them. He had received as a legacy from an uncle a few shares of stock in the Traders’ Bank, and now his joy was turned to bitterness: he had to sacrifice everything he had in the world, and his feeling against Paul Armstrong, dead, as he was, must have been bitter in the extreme. He was asked to officiate at the simple services when the dead banker’s body was interred in Casanova churchyard, but the good man providentially took cold, and a substitute was called in.  A few days after the services he called to see me, a kind-faced little man, in a very bad frock-coat and laundered tie. I think he was uncertain as to my connection with the Armstrong family, and dubious whether I considered Mr. Armstrong’s taking away a matter for condolence or congratulation. He was not long in doubt.  I liked the little man. He had known Thomas well, and had promised to officiate at the services in the rickety African Zion Church. He told me more of himself than he knew, and before he left, I astonished him—and myself, I admit—by promising a new carpet for his church. He was much affected, and I gathered that he had yearned over his ragged chapel as a mother over a half-clothed child.  “You are laying up treasure, Miss Innes,” he said brokenly, “where neither moth nor rust corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.”  “It is certainly a safer place than Sunnyside,” I admitted. And the thought of the carpet permitted him to smile. He stood just inside the doorway, looking from the luxury of the house to the beauty of the view.  “The rich ought to be good,” he said wistfully. “They have so much that is beautiful, and beauty is ennobling. And yet—while I ought to say nothing but good of the dead—Mr. Armstrong saw nothing of this fair prospect. To him these trees and lawns were not the work of God. They were property, at so much an acre. He loved money, Miss Innes. He offered up everything to his golden calf. Not power, not ambition, was his fetish: it was money.” Then he dropped his pulpit manner, and, turning to me with his engaging smile: “In spite of all this luxury,” he said, “the country people here have a saying that Mr. Paul Armstrong could sit on a dollar and see all around it. Unlike the summer people, he gave neither to the poor nor to the church. He loved money for its own sake.”  “And there are no pockets in shrouds!” I said cynically.  I sent him home in the car, with a bunch of hot-house roses for his wife, and he was quite overwhelmed. As for me, I had a generous glow that was cheap at the price of a church carpet. I received less gratification—and less gratitude—when I presented the new silver communion set to St. Barnabas.  I had a great many things to think about in those days. I made out a list of questions and possible answers, but I seemed only to be working around in a circle. I always ended where I began. The list was something like this:  Who had entered the house the night before the murder?  Thomas claimed it was Mr. Bailey, whom he had seen on the foot-path, and who owned the pearl cuff-link.  Why did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left the house the night he was killed?  No answer. Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned?  Who admitted him?  Gertrude said she had locked the east entry. There was no key on the dead man or in the door. He must have been admitted from within.  Who had been locked in the clothes chute?  Some one unfamiliar with the house, evidently. Only two people missing from the household, Rosie and Gertrude. Rosie had been at the lodge. Therefore—but was it Gertrude? Might it not have been the mysterious intruder again?  Who had accosted Rosie on the drive?  Again—perhaps the nightly visitor. It seemed more likely some one who suspected a secret at the lodge. Was Louise under surveillance?  Who had passed Louise on the circular staircase?  Could it have been Thomas? The key to the east entry made this a possibility. But why was he there, if it were indeed he?  Who had made the hole in the trunk-room wall?  It was not vandalism. It had been done quietly, and with deliberate purpose. If I had only known how to read the purpose of that gaping aperture what I might have saved in anxiety and mental strain!  Why had Louise left her people and come home to hide at the lodge?  There was no answer, as yet, to this, or to the next questions.  Why did both she and Doctor Walker warn us away from the house?  Who was Lucien Wallace?  What did Thomas see in the shadows the night he died?  What was the meaning of the subtle change in Gertrude?  Was Jack Bailey an accomplice or a victim in the looting of the Traders’ Bank?  What all-powerful reason made Louise determine to marry Doctor Walker?  The examiners were still working on the books of the Traders’ Bank, and it was probable that several weeks would elapse before everything was cleared up. The firm of expert accountants who had examined the books some two months before testified that every bond, every piece of valuable paper, was there at that time. It had been shortly after their examination that the president, who had been in bad health, had gone to California. Mr. Bailey was still ill at the Knickerbocker, and in this, as in other ways, Gertrude’s conduct puzzled me. She seemed indifferent, refused to discuss matters pertaining to the bank, and never, to my knowledge, either wrote to him or went to see him.  Gradually I came to the conclusion that Gertrude, with the rest of the world, believed her lover guilty, and—although I believed it myself, for that matter—I was irritated by her indifference. Girls in my day did not meekly accept the public’s verdict as to the man they loved.  But presently something occurred that made me think that under Gertrude’s surface calm there was a seething flood of emotions.  Tuesday morning the detective made a careful search of the grounds, but he found nothing. In the afternoon he disappeared, and it was late that night when he came home. He said he would have to go back to the city the following day, and arranged with Halsey and Alex to guard the house.  Liddy came to me on Wednesday morning with her black silk apron held up like a bag, and her eyes big with virtuous wrath. It was the day of Thomas’ funeral in the village, and Alex and I were in the conservatory cutting flowers for the old man’s casket. Liddy is never so happy as when she is making herself wretched, and now her mouth drooped while her eyes were triumphant.  “I always said there were plenty of things going on here, right under our noses, that we couldn’t see,” she said, holding out her apron.  “I don’t see with my nose,” I remarked. “What have you got there?”  Liddy pushed aside a half-dozen geranium pots, and in the space thus cleared she dumped the contents of her apron—a handful of tiny bits of paper. Alex had stepped back, but I saw him watching her curiously.  “Wait a moment, Liddy,” I said. “You have been going through the library paper-basket again!”  Liddy was arranging her bits of paper with the skill of long practice and paid no attention.  “Did it ever occur to you,” I went on, putting my hand over the scraps, “that when people tear up their correspondence, it is for the express purpose of keeping it from being read?”  “If they wasn’t ashamed of it they wouldn’t take so much trouble, Miss Rachel,” Liddy said oracularly. “More than that, with things happening every day, I consider it my duty. If you don’t read and act on this, I shall give it to that Jamieson, and I’ll venture he’ll not go back to the city to-day.”  That decided me. If the scraps had anything to do with the mystery ordinary conventions had no value. So Liddy arranged the scraps, like working out one of the puzzle-pictures children play with, and she did it with much the same eagerness. When it was finished she stepped aside while I read it.  “Wednesday night, nine o’clock. Bridge,” I real aloud. Then, aware of Alex’s stare, I turned on Liddy.  “Some one is to play bridge to-night at nine o’clock,” I said. “Is that your business, or mine?”  Liddy was aggrieved. She was about to reply when I scooped up the pieces and left the conservatory.  “Now then,” I said, when we got outside, “will you tell me why you choose to take Alex into your confidence? He’s no fool. Do you suppose he thinks any one in this house is going to play bridge to-night at nine o’clock, by appointment! I suppose you have shown it in the kitchen, and instead of my being able to slip down to the bridge to-night quietly, and see who is there, the whole household will be going in a procession.”  “Nobody knows it,” Liddy said humbly. “I found it in the basket in Miss Gertrude’s dressing-room. Look at the back of the sheet.” I turned over some of the scraps, and, sure enough, it was a blank deposit slip from the Traders’ Bank. So Gertrude was going to meet Jack Bailey that night by the bridge! And I had thought he was ill! It hardly seemed like the action of an innocent man—this avoidance of daylight, and of his fiancée’s people. I decided to make certain, however, by going to the bridge that night.  After luncheon Mr. Jamieson suggested that I go with him to Richfield, and I consented.  “I am inclined to place more faith in Doctor Stewart’s story,” he said, “since I found that scrap in old Thomas’ pocket. It bears out the statement that the woman with the child, and the woman who quarreled with Armstrong, are the same. It looks as if Thomas had stumbled on to some affair which was more or less discreditable to the dead man, and, with a certain loyalty to the family, had kept it to himself. Then, you see, your story about the woman at the card-room window begins to mean something. It is the nearest approach to anything tangible that we have had yet.”  Warner took us to Richfield in the car. It was about twenty-five miles by railroad, but by taking a series of atrociously rough short cuts we got there very quickly. It was a pretty little town, on the river, and back on the hill I could see the Mortons’ big country house, where Halsey and Gertrude had been staying until the night of the murder.  Elm Street was almost the only street, and number fourteen was easily found. It was a small white house, dilapidated without having gained anything picturesque, with a low window and a porch only a foot or so above the bit of a lawn. There was a baby-carriage in the path, and from a swing at the side came the sound of conflict. Three small children were disputing vociferously, and a faded young woman with a kindly face was trying to hush the clamor. When she saw us she untied her gingham apron and came around to the porch.  “Good afternoon,” I said. Jamieson lifted his hat, without speaking. “I came to inquire about a child named Lucien Wallace.”  “I am glad you have come,” she said. “In spite of the other children, I think the little fellow is lonely. We thought perhaps his mother would be here to-day.”  Mr. Jamieson stepped forward.  “You are Mrs. Tate?” I wondered how the detective knew.  “Yes, sir.”  “Mrs. Tate, we want to make some inquiries. Perhaps in the house—”  “Come right in,” she said hospitably. And soon we were in the little shabby parlor, exactly like a thousand of its prototypes. Mrs. Tate sat uneasily, her hands folded in her lap.  “How long has Lucien been here?” Mr. Jamieson asked.  “Since a week ago last Friday. His mother paid one week’s board in advance; the other has not been paid.”  “Was he ill when he came?”  “No, sir, not what you’d call sick. He was getting better of typhoid, she said, and he’s picking up fine.”  “Will you tell me his mother’s name and address?”  “That’s the trouble,” the young woman said, knitting her brows. “She gave her name as Mrs. Wallace, and said she had no address. She was looking for a boarding-house in town. She said she worked in a department store, and couldn’t take care of the child properly, and he needed fresh air and milk. I had three children of my own, and one more didn’t make much difference in the work, but—I wish she would pay this week’s board.”  “Did she say what store it was?”  “No, sir, but all the boy’s clothes came from King’s. He has far too fine clothes for the country.”  There was a chorus of shouts and shrill yells from the front door, followed by the loud stamping of children’s feet and a throaty “whoa, whoa!” Into the room came a tandem team of two chubby youngsters, a boy and a girl, harnessed with a clothes-line, and driven by a laughing boy of about seven, in tan overalls and brass buttons. The small driver caught my attention at once: he was a beautiful child, and, although he showed traces of recent severe illness, his skin had now the clear transparency of health.  “Whoa, Flinders,” he shouted. “You’re goin’ to smash the trap.”  Mr. Jamieson coaxed him over by holding out a lead-pencil, striped blue and yellow.  “Now, then,” he said, when the boy had taken the lead-pencil and was testing its usefulness on the detective’s cuff, “now then, I’ll bet you don’t know what your name is!”  “I do,” said the boy. “Lucien Wallace.”  “Great! And what’s your mother’s name?”  “Mother, of course. What’s your mother’s name?” And he pointed to me! I am going to stop wearing black: it doubles a woman’s age.  “And where did you live before you came here?” The detective was polite enough not to smile.  “_Grossmutter_,” he said. And I saw Mr. Jamieson’s eyebrows go up.  “German,” he commented. “Well, young man, you don’t seem to know much about yourself.”  “I’ve tried it all week,” Mrs. Tate broke in. “The boy knows a word or two of German, but he doesn’t know where he lived, or anything about himself.”  Mr. Jamieson wrote something on a card and gave it to her.  “Mrs. Tate,” he said, “I want you to do something. Here is some money for the telephone call. The instant the boy’s mother appears here, call up that number and ask for the person whose name is there. You can run across to the drug-store on an errand and do it quietly. Just say, ‘The lady has come.’”  “‘The lady has come,’” repeated Mrs. Tate. “Very well, sir, and I hope it will be soon. The milk-bill alone is almost double what it was.”  “How much is the child’s board?” I asked.  “Three dollars a week, including his washing.”  “Very well,” I said. “Now, Mrs. Tate, I am going to pay last week’s board and a week in advance. If the mother comes, she is to know nothing of this visit—absolutely not a word, and, in return for your silence, you may use this money for—something for your own children.”  Her tired, faded face lighted up, and I saw her glance at the little Tates’ small feet. Shoes, I divined—the feet of the genteel poor being almost as expensive as their stomachs.  As we went back Mr. Jamieson made only one remark: I think he was laboring under the weight of a great disappointment.  “Is King’s a children’s outfitting place?” he asked.  “Not especially. It is a general department store.”  He was silent after that, but he went to the telephone as soon as we got home, and called up King and Company, in the city.  After a time he got the general manager, and they talked for some time. When Mr. Jamieson hung up the receiver he turned to me.  “The plot thickens,” he said with his ready smile. “There are four women named Wallace at King’s, none of them married, and none over twenty. I think I shall go up to the city to-night. I want to go to the Children’s Hospital. But before I go, Miss Innes, I wish you would be more frank with me than you have been yet. I want you to show me the revolver you picked up in the tulip bed.”  So he had known all along!  “It _was_ a revolver, Mr. Jamieson,” I admitted, cornered at last, “but I can not show it to you. It is not in my possession.”     CHAPTER XXII. A LADDER OUT OF PLACE   At dinner Mr. Jamieson suggested sending a man out in his place for a couple of days, but Halsey was certain there would be nothing more, and felt that he and Alex could manage the situation. The detective went back to town early in the evening, and by nine o’clock Halsey, who had been playing golf—as a man does anything to take his mind away from trouble—was sleeping soundly on the big leather davenport in the living-room.  I sat and knitted, pretending not to notice when Gertrude got up and wandered out into the starlight. As soon as I was satisfied that she had gone, however, I went out cautiously. I had no intention of eavesdropping, but I wanted to be certain that it was Jack Bailey she was meeting. Too many things had occurred in which Gertrude was, or appeared to be, involved, to allow anything to be left in question.  I went slowly across the lawn, skirted the hedge to a break not far from the lodge, and found myself on the open road. Perhaps a hundred feet to the left the path led across the valley to the Country Club, and only a little way off was the foot-bridge over Casanova Creek. But just as I was about to turn down the path I heard steps coming toward me, and I shrank into the bushes. It was Gertrude, going back quickly toward the house.  I was surprised. I waited until she had had time to get almost to the house before I started. And then I stepped back again into the shadows. The reason why Gertrude had not kept her tryst was evident. Leaning on the parapet of the bridge in the moonlight, and smoking a pipe, was Alex, the gardener. I could have throttled Liddy for her carelessness in reading the torn note where he could hear. And I could cheerfully have choked Alex to death for his audacity.  But there was no help for it: I turned and followed Gertrude slowly back to the house.  The frequent invasions of the house had effectually prevented any relaxation after dusk. We had redoubled our vigilance as to bolts and window-locks but, as Mr. Jamieson had suggested, we allowed the door at the east entry to remain as before, locked by the Yale lock only. To provide only one possible entrance for the invader, and to keep a constant guard in the dark at the foot of the circular staircase, seemed to be the only method.  In the absence of the detective, Alex and Halsey arranged to change off, Halsey to be on duty from ten to two, and Alex from two until six. Each man was armed, and, as an additional precaution, the one off duty slept in a room near the head of the circular staircase and kept his door open, to be ready for emergency.  These arrangements were carefully kept from the servants, who were only commencing to sleep at night, and who retired, one and all, with barred doors and lamps that burned full until morning.  The house was quiet again Wednesday night. It was almost a week since Louise had encountered some one on the stairs, and it was four days since the discovery of the hole in the trunk-room wall.  Arnold Armstrong and his father rested side by side in the Casanova churchyard, and at the Zion African Church, on the hill, a new mound marked the last resting-place of poor Thomas.  Louise was with her mother in town, and, beyond a polite note of thanks to me, we had heard nothing from her. Doctor Walker had taken up his practice again, and we saw him now and then flying past along the road, always at top speed. The murder of Arnold Armstrong was still unavenged, and I remained firm in the position I had taken—to stay at Sunnyside until the thing was at least partly cleared.  And yet, for all its quiet, it was on Wednesday night that perhaps the boldest attempt was made to enter the house. On Thursday afternoon the laundress sent word she would like to speak to me, and I saw her in my private sitting-room, a small room beyond the dressing-room.  Mary Anne was embarrassed. She had rolled down her sleeves and tied a white apron around her waist, and she stood making folds in it with fingers that were red and shiny from her soap-suds.  “Well, Mary,” I said encouragingly, “what’s the matter? Don’t dare to tell me the soap is out.”  “No, ma’m, Miss Innes.” She had a nervous habit of looking first at my one eye and then at the other, her own optics shifting ceaselessly, right eye, left eye, right eye, until I found myself doing the same thing. “No, ma’m. I was askin’ did you want the ladder left up the clothes chute?”  “The what?” I screeched, and was sorry the next minute. Seeing her suspicions were verified, Mary Anne had gone white, and stood with her eyes shifting more wildly than ever.  “There’s a ladder up the clothes chute, Miss Innes,” she said. “It’s up that tight I can’t move it, and I didn’t like to ask for help until I spoke to you.”  It was useless to dissemble; Mary Anne knew now as well as I did that the ladder had no business to be there. I did the best I could, however. I put her on the defensive at once.  “Then you didn’t lock the laundry last night?”  “I locked it tight, and put the key in the kitchen on its nail.”  “Very well, then you forgot a window.”  Mary Anne hesitated.  “Yes’m,” she said at last. “I thought I locked them all, but there was one open this morning.”  I went out of the room and down the hall, followed by Mary Anne. The door into the clothes chute was securely bolted, and when I opened it I saw the evidence of the woman’s story. A pruning-ladder had been brought from where it had lain against the stable and now stood upright in the clothes shaft, its end resting against the wall between the first and second floors.  I turned to Mary.  “This is due to your carelessness,” I said. “If we had all been murdered in our beds it would have been your fault.” She shivered. “Now, not a word of this through the house, and send Alex to me.”  The effect on Alex was to make him apoplectic with rage, and with it all I fancied there was an element of satisfaction. As I look back, so many things are plain to me that I wonder I could not see at the time. It is all known now, and yet the whole thing was so remarkable that perhaps my stupidity was excusable.  Alex leaned down the chute and examined the ladder carefully.  “It is caught,” he said with a grim smile. “The fools, to have left a warning like that! The only trouble is, Miss Innes, they won’t be apt to come back for a while.”  “I shouldn’t regard that in the light of a calamity,” I replied.  Until late that evening Halsey and Alex worked at the chute. They forced down the ladder at last, and put a new bolt on the door. As for myself, I sat and wondered if I had a deadly enemy, intent on my destruction.  I was growing more and more nervous. Liddy had given up all pretense at bravery, and slept regularly in my dressing-room on the couch, with a prayer-book and a game knife from the kitchen under her pillow, thus preparing for both the natural and the supernatural. That was the way things stood that Thursday night, when I myself took a hand in the struggle.     CHAPTER XXIII. WHILE THE STABLES BURNED   About nine o’clock that night Liddy came into the living-room and reported that one of the housemaids declared she had seen two men slip around the corner of the stable. Gertrude had been sitting staring in front of her, jumping at every sound. Now she turned on Liddy pettishly.  “I declare, Liddy,” she said, “you are a bundle of nerves. What if Eliza did see some men around the stable? It may have been Warner and Alex.”  “Warner is in the kitchen, miss,” Liddy said with dignity. “And if you had come through what I have, you would be a bundle of nerves, too. Miss Rachel, I’d be thankful if you’d give me my month’s wages to-morrow. I’ll be going to my sister’s.”  “Very well,” I said, to her evident amazement. “I will make out the check. Warner can take you down to the noon train.”  Liddy’s face was really funny.  “You’ll have a nice time at your sister’s,” I went on. “Five children, hasn’t she?”  “That’s it,” Liddy said, suddenly bursting into tears. “Send me away, after all these years, and your new shawl only half done, and nobody knowin’ how to fix the water for your bath.”  “It’s time I learned to prepare my own bath.” I was knitting complacently. But Gertrude got up and put her arms around Liddy’s shaking shoulders.  “You are two big babies,” she said soothingly. “Neither one of you could get along for an hour without the other. So stop quarreling and be good. Liddy, go right up and lay out Aunty’s night things. She is going to bed early.”  After Liddy had gone I began to think about the men at the stable, and I grew more and more anxious. Halsey was aimlessly knocking the billiard-balls around in the billiard-room, and I called to him.  “Halsey,” I said when he sauntered in, “is there a policeman in Casanova?”  “Constable,” he said laconically. “Veteran of the war, one arm; in office to conciliate the G. A. R. element. Why?”  “Because I am uneasy to-night.” And I told him what Liddy had said. “Is there any one you can think of who could be relied on to watch the outside of the house to-night?”  “We might get Sam Bohannon from the club,” he said thoughtfully. “It wouldn’t be a bad scheme. He’s a smart darky, and with his mouth shut and his shirt-front covered, you couldn’t see him a yard off in the dark.”  Halsey conferred with Alex, and the result, in an hour, was Sam. His instructions were simple. There had been numerous attempts to break into the house; it was the intention, not to drive intruders away, but to capture them. If Sam saw anything suspicious outside, he was to tap at the east entry, where Alex and Halsey were to alternate in keeping watch through the night.  It was with a comfortable feeling of security that I went to bed that night. The door between Gertrude’s rooms and mine had been opened, and, with the doors into the hall bolted, we were safe enough. Although Liddy persisted in her belief that doors would prove no obstacles to our disturbers.  As before, Halsey watched the east entry from ten until two. He had an eye to comfort, and he kept vigil in a heavy oak chair, very large and deep. We went up-stairs rather early, and through the open door Gertrude and I kept up a running fire of conversation. Liddy was brushing my hair, and Gertrude was doing her own, with a long free sweep of her strong round arms.  “Did you know Mrs. Armstrong and Louise are in the village?” she called.  “No,” I replied, startled. “How did you hear it?”  “I met the oldest Stewart girl to-day, the doctor’s daughter, and she told me they had not gone back to town after the funeral. They went directly to that little yellow house next to Doctor Walker’s, and are apparently settled there. They took the house furnished for the summer.”  “Why, it’s a bandbox,” I said. “I can’t imagine Fanny Armstrong in such a place.”  “It’s true, nevertheless. Ella Stewart says Mrs. Armstrong has aged terribly, and looks as if she is hardly able to walk.”  I lay and thought over some of these things until midnight. The electric lights went out then, fading slowly until there was only a red-hot loop to be seen in the bulb, and then even that died away and we were embarked on the darkness of another night.  Apparently only a few minutes elapsed, during which my eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness. Then I noticed that the windows were reflecting a faint pinkish light, Liddy noticed it at the same time, and I heard her jump up. At that moment Sam’s deep voice boomed from somewhere just below.  “Fire!” he yelled. “The stable’s on fire!”  I could see him in the glare dancing up and down on the drive, and a moment later Halsey joined him. Alex was awake and running down the stairs, and in five minutes from the time the fire was discovered, three of the maids were sitting on their trunks in the drive, although, excepting a few sparks, there was no fire nearer than a hundred yards.  Gertrude seldom loses her presence of mind, and she ran to the telephone. But by the time the Casanova volunteer fire department came toiling up the hill the stable was a furnace, with the Dragon Fly safe but blistered, in the road. Some gasolene exploded just as the volunteer department got to work, which shook their nerves as well as the burning building. The stable, being on a hill, was a torch to attract the population from every direction. Rumor had it that Sunnyside was burning, and it was amazing how many people threw something over their night-clothes and flew to the conflagration.  I take it Casanova has few fires, and Sunnyside was furnishing the people, in one way and another, the greatest excitement they had had for years.  The stable was off the west wing. I hardly know how I came to think of the circular staircase and the unguarded door at its foot. Liddy was putting my clothes into sheets, preparatory to tossing them out the window, when I found her, and I could hardly persuade her to stop.  “I want you to come with me, Liddy,” I said. “Bring a candle and a couple of blankets.”  She lagged behind considerably when she saw me making for the east wing, and at the top of the staircase she balked.  “I am not going down there,” she said firmly.  “There is no one guarding the door down there,” I explained. “Who knows?—this may be a scheme to draw everybody away from this end of the house, and let some one in here.”  The instant I had said it I was convinced I had hit on the explanation, and that perhaps it was already too late. It seemed to me as I listened that I heard stealthy footsteps on the east porch, but there was so much shouting outside that it was impossible to tell. Liddy was on the point of retreat.  “Very well,” I said, “then I shall go down alone. Run back to Mr. Halsey’s room and get his revolver. Don’t shoot down the stairs if you hear a noise: remember—I shall be down there. And hurry.”  I put the candle on the floor at the top of the staircase and took off my bedroom slippers. Then I crept down the stairs, going very slowly, and listening with all my ears. I was keyed to such a pitch that I felt no fear: like the condemned who sleep and eat the night before execution, I was no longer able to suffer apprehension. I was past that. Just at the foot of the stairs I stubbed my toe against Halsey’s big chair, and had to stand on one foot in a soundless agony until the pain subsided to a dull ache. And then—I knew I was right. Some one had put a key into the lock, and was turning it. For some reason it refused to work, and the key was withdrawn. There was a muttering of voices outside: I had only a second. Another trial, and the door would open. The candle above made a faint gleam down the well-like staircase, and at that moment, with a second, no more, to spare, I thought of a plan.  The heavy oak chair almost filled the space between the newel post and the door. With a crash I had turned it on its side, wedging it against the door, its legs against the stairs. I could hear a faint scream from Liddy, at the crash, and then she came down the stairs on a run, with the revolver held straight out in front of her.  “Thank God,” she said, in a shaking voice. “I thought it was you.”  I pointed to the door, and she understood.  “Call out the windows at the other end of the house,” I whispered. “Run. Tell them not to wait for anything.”  She went up the stairs at that, two at a time. Evidently she collided with the candle, for it went out, and I was left in darkness.  I was really astonishingly cool. I remember stepping over the chair and gluing my ear to the door, and I shall never forget feeling it give an inch or two there in the darkness, under a steady pressure from without. But the chair held, although I could hear an ominous cracking of one of the legs. And then, without the slightest warning, the card-room window broke with a crash. I had my finger on the trigger of the revolver, and as I jumped it went off, right through the door. Some one outside swore roundly, and for the first time I could hear what was said.  “Only a scratch. . . . Men are at the other end of the house. . . . Have the whole rat’s nest on us.” And a lot of profanity which I won’t write down. The voices were at the broken window now, and although I was trembling violently, I was determined that I would hold them until help came. I moved up the stairs until I could see into the card-room, or rather through it, to the window. As I looked a small man put his leg over the sill and stepped into the room. The curtain confused him for a moment; then he turned, not toward me, but toward the billiard-room door. I fired again, and something that was glass or china crashed to the ground. Then I ran up the stairs and along the corridor to the main staircase. Gertrude was standing there, trying to locate the shots, and I must have been a peculiar figure, with my hair in crimps, my dressing-gown flying, no slippers, and a revolver clutched in my hands I had no time to talk. There was the sound of footsteps in the lower hall, and some one bounded up the stairs.  I had gone Berserk, I think. I leaned over the stair-rail and fired again. Halsey, below, yelled at me.  “What are you doing up there?” he yelled. “You missed me by an inch.”  And then I collapsed and fainted. When I came around Liddy was rubbing my temples with eau de quinine, and the search was in full blast.  Well, the man was gone. The stable burned to the ground, while the crowd cheered at every falling rafter, and the volunteer fire department sprayed it with a garden hose. And in the house Alex and Halsey searched every corner of the lower floor, finding no one.  The truth of my story was shown by the broken window and the overturned chair. That the unknown had got up-stairs was almost impossible. He had not used the main staircase, there was no way to the upper floor in the east wing, and Liddy had been at the window, in the west wing, where the servants’ stair went up. But we did not go to bed at all. Sam Bohannon and Warner helped in the search, and not a closet escaped scrutiny. Even the cellars were given a thorough overhauling, without result. The door in the east entry had a hole through it where my bullet had gone.  The hole slanted downward, and the bullet was embedded in the porch. Some reddish stains showed it had done execution.  “Somebody will walk lame,” Halsey said, when he had marked the course of the bullet. “It’s too low to have hit anything but a leg or foot.”  From that time on I watched every person I met for a limp, and to this day the man who halts in his walk is an object of suspicion to me. But Casanova had no lame men: the nearest approach to it was an old fellow who tended the safety gates at the railroad, and he, I learned on inquiry, had two artificial legs. Our man had gone, and the large and expensive stable at Sunnyside was a heap of smoking rafters and charred boards. Warner swore the fire was incendiary, and in view of the attempt to enter the house, there seemed to be no doubt of it.     CHAPTER XXIV. FLINDERS   If Halsey had only taken me fully into his confidence, through the whole affair, it would have been much simpler. If he had been altogether frank about Jack Bailey, and if the day after the fire he had told me what he suspected, there would have been no harrowing period for all of us, with the boy in danger. But young people refuse to profit by the experience of their elders, and sometimes the elders are the ones to suffer.  I was much used up the day after the fire, and Gertrude insisted on my going out. The machine was temporarily out of commission, and the carriage horses had been sent to a farm for the summer. Gertrude finally got a trap from the Casanova liveryman, and we went out. Just as we turned from the drive into the road we passed a woman. She had put down a small valise, and stood inspecting the house and grounds minutely. I should hardly have noticed her, had it not been for the fact that she had been horribly disfigured by smallpox.  “Ugh!” Gertrude said, when we had passed, “what a face! I shall dream of it to-night. Get up, Flinders.”  “Flinders?” I asked. “Is that the horse’s name?”  “It is.” She flicked the horse’s stubby mane with the whip. “He didn’t look like a livery horse, and the liveryman said he had bought him from the Armstrongs when they purchased a couple of motors and cut down the stable. Nice Flinders—good old boy!”  Flinders was certainly not a common name for a horse, and yet the youngster at Richfield had named his prancing, curly-haired little horse Flinders! It set me to thinking.  At my request Halsey had already sent word of the fire to the agent from whom we had secured the house. Also, he had called Mr. Jamieson by telephone, and somewhat guardedly had told him of the previous night’s events. Mr. Jamieson promised to come out that night, and to bring another man with him. I did not consider it necessary to notify Mrs. Armstrong, in the village. No doubt she knew of the fire, and in view of my refusal to give up the house, an interview would probably have been unpleasant enough. But as we passed Doctor Walker’s white and green house I thought of something.  “Stop here, Gertrude,” I said. “I am going to get out.”  “To see Louise?” she asked.  “No, I want to ask this young Walker something.”  She was curious, I knew, but I did not wait to explain. I went up the walk to the house, where a brass sign at the side announced the office, and went in. The reception-room was empty, but from the consulting-room beyond came the sound of two voices, not very amicable.  “It is an outrageous figure,” some one was storming. Then the doctor’s quiet tone, evidently not arguing, merely stating something. But I had not time to listen to some person probably disputing his bill, so I coughed. The voices ceased at once: a door closed somewhere, and the doctor entered from the hall of the house. He looked sufficiently surprised at seeing me.  “Good afternoon, Doctor,” I said formally. “I shall not keep you from your patient. I wish merely to ask you a question.”  “Won’t you sit down?”  “It will not be necessary. Doctor, has any one come to you, either early this morning or to-day, to have you treat a bullet wound?”  “Nothing so startling has happened to me,” he said. “A bullet wound! Things must be lively at Sunnyside.”  “I didn’t say it was at Sunnyside. But as it happens, it was. If any such case comes to you, will it be too much trouble for you to let me know?”  “I shall be only too happy,” he said. “I understand you have had a fire up there, too. A fire and shooting in one night is rather lively for a quiet place like that.”  “It is as quiet as a boiler-shop,” I replied, as I turned to go.  “And you are still going to stay?”  “Until I am burned out,” I responded. And then on my way down the steps, I turned around suddenly.  “Doctor,” I asked at a venture, “have you ever heard of a child named Lucien Wallace?”  Clever as he was, his face changed and stiffened. He was on his guard again in a moment.  “Lucien Wallace?” he repeated. “No, I think not. There are plenty of Wallaces around, but I don’t know any Lucien.”  I was as certain as possible that he did. People do not lie readily to me, and this man lied beyond a doubt. But there was nothing to be gained now; his defenses were up, and I left, half irritated and wholly baffled.  Our reception was entirely different at Doctor Stewart’s. Taken into the bosom of the family at once, Flinders tied outside and nibbling the grass at the roadside, Gertrude and I drank some home-made elderberry wine and told briefly of the fire. Of the more serious part of the night’s experience, of course, we said nothing. But when at last we had left the family on the porch and the good doctor was untying our steed, I asked him the same question I had put to Doctor Walker.  “Shot!” he said. “Bless my soul, no. Why, what have you been doing up at the big house, Miss Innes?”  “Some one tried to enter the house during the fire, and was shot and slightly injured,” I said hastily. “Please don’t mention it; we wish to make as little of it as possible.”  There was one other possibility, and we tried that. At Casanova station I saw the station master, and asked him if any trains left Casanova between one o’clock and daylight. There was none until six A.M. The next question required more diplomacy.  “Did you notice on the six-o’clock train any person—any man—who limped a little?” I asked. “Please try to remember: we are trying to trace a man who was seen loitering around Sunnyside last night before the fire.”  He was all attention in a moment.  “I was up there myself at the fire,” he said volubly. “I’m a member of the volunteer company. First big fire we’ve had since the summer house burned over to the club golf links. My wife was sayin’ the other day, ‘Dave, you might as well ’a’ saved the money in that there helmet and shirt.’ And here last night they came in handy. Rang that bell so hard I hadn’t time scarcely to get ’em on.”  “And—did you see a man who limped?” Gertrude put in, as he stopped for breath.  “Not at the train, ma’m,” he said. “No such person got on here to-day. But I’ll tell you where I did see a man that limped. I didn’t wait till the fire company left; there’s a fast freight goes through at four forty-five, and I had to get down to the station. I seen there wasn’t much more to do anyhow at the fire—we’d got the flames under control”—Gertrude looked at me and smiled—“so I started down the hill. There was folks here and there goin’ home, and along by the path to the Country Club I seen two men. One was a short fellow. He was sitting on a big rock, his back to me, and he had something white in his hand, as if he was tying up his foot. After I’d gone on a piece I looked back, and he was hobbling on and—excuse me, miss—he was swearing something sickening.”  “Did they go toward the club?” Gertrude asked suddenly, leaning forward.  “No, miss. I think they came into the village. I didn’t get a look at their faces, but I know every chick and child in the place, and everybody knows me. When they didn’t shout at me—in my uniform, you know—I took it they were strangers.”  So all we had for our afternoon’s work was this: some one had been shot by the bullet that went through the door; he had not left the village, and he had not called in a physician. Also, Doctor Walker knew who Lucien Wallace was, and his very denial made me confident that, in that one direction at least, we were on the right track.  The thought that the detective would be there that night was the most cheering thing of all, and I think even Gertrude was glad of it. Driving home that afternoon, I saw her in the clear sunlight for the first time in several days, and I was startled to see how ill she looked. She was thin and colorless, and all her bright animation was gone.  “Gertrude,” I said, “I have been a very selfish old woman. You are going to leave this miserable house to-night. Annie Morton is going to Scotland next week, and you shall go right with her.”  To my surprise, she flushed painfully.  “I don’t want to go, Aunt Ray,” she said. “Don’t make me leave now.”  “You are losing your health and your good looks,” I said decidedly. “You should have a change.”  “I shan’t stir a foot.” She was equally decided. Then, more lightly: “Why, you and Liddy need me to arbitrate between you every day in the week.”  Perhaps I was growing suspicious of every one, but it seemed to me that Gertrude’s gaiety was forced and artificial. I watched her covertly during the rest of the drive, and I did not like the two spots of crimson in her pale cheeks. But I said nothing more about sending her to Scotland: I knew she would not go.     CHAPTER XXV. A VISIT FROM LOUISE   That day was destined to be an eventful one, for when I entered the house and found Eliza ensconced in the upper hall on a chair, with Mary Anne doing her best to stifle her with household ammonia, and Liddy rubbing her wrists—whatever good that is supposed to do—I knew that the ghost had been walking again, and this time in daylight.  Eliza was in a frenzy of fear. She clutched at my sleeve when I went close to her, and refused to let go until she had told her story. Coming just after the fire, the household was demoralized, and it was no surprise to me to find Alex and the under-gardener struggling down-stairs with a heavy trunk between them.  “I didn’t want to do it, Miss Innes,” Alex said. “But she was so excited, I was afraid she would do as she said—drag it down herself, and scratch the staircase.”  I was trying to get my bonnet off and to keep the maids quiet at the same time. “Now, Eliza, when you have washed your face and stopped bawling,” I said, “come into my sitting-room and tell me what has happened.”  Liddy put away my things without speaking. The very set of her shoulders expressed disapproval.  “Well,” I said, when the silence became uncomfortable, “things seem to be warming up.”  Silence from Liddy, and a long sigh.  “If Eliza goes, I don’t know where to look for another cook.” More silence.  “Rosie is probably a good cook.” Sniff.  “Liddy,” I said at last, “don’t dare to deny that you are having the time of your life. You positively gloat in this excitement. You never looked better. It’s my opinion all this running around, and getting jolted out of a rut, has stirred up that torpid liver of yours.”  “It’s not myself I’m thinking about,” she said, goaded into speech. “Maybe my liver was torpid, and maybe it wasn’t; but I know this: I’ve got some feelings left, and to see you standing at the foot of that staircase shootin’ through the door—I’ll never be the same woman again.”  “Well, I’m glad of that—anything for a change,” I said. And in came Eliza, flanked by Rosie and Mary Anne.  Her story, broken with sobs and corrections from the other two, was this: At two o’clock (two-fifteen, Rosie insisted) she had gone up-stairs to get a picture from her room to show Mary Anne. (A picture of a _lady_, Mary Anne interposed.) She went up the servants’ staircase and along the corridor to her room, which lay between the trunk-room and the unfinished ball-room. She heard a sound as she went down the corridor, like some one moving furniture, but she was not nervous. She thought it might be men examining the house after the fire the night before, but she looked in the trunk-room and saw nobody.  She went into her room quietly. The noise had ceased, and everything was quiet. Then she sat down on the side of her bed, and, feeling faint—she was subject to spells—(“I told you that when I came, didn’t I, Rosie?” “Yes’m, indeed she did!”)—she put her head down on her pillow and—  “Took a nap. All right!” I said. “Go on.”  “When I came to, Miss Innes, sure as I’m sittin’ here, I thought I’d die. Somethin’ hit me on the face, and I set up, sudden. And then I seen the plaster drop, droppin’ from a little hole in the wall. And the first thing I knew, an iron bar that long” (fully two yards by her measure) “shot through that hole and tumbled on the bed. If I’d been still sleeping” (“Fainting,” corrected Rosie) “I’d ’a’ been hit on the head and killed!”  “I wisht you’d heard her scream,” put in Mary Anne. “And her face as white as a pillow-slip when she tumbled down the stairs.”  “No doubt there is some natural explanation for it, Eliza,” I said. “You may have dreamed it, in your ‘fainting’ attack. But if it is true, the metal rod and the hole in the wall will show it.”  Eliza looked a little bit sheepish.  “The hole’s there all right, Miss Innes,” she said. “But the bar was gone when Mary Anne and Rosie went up to pack my trunk.”  “That wasn’t all,” Liddy’s voice came funereally from a corner. “Eliza said that from the hole in the wall a burning eye looked down at her!”  “The wall must be at least six inches thick,” I said with asperity. “Unless the person who drilled the hole carried his eyes on the ends of a stick, Eliza couldn’t possibly have seen them.”  But the fact remained, and a visit to Eliza’s room proved it. I might jeer all I wished: some one had drilled a hole in the unfinished wall of the ball-room, passing between the bricks of the partition, and shooting through the unresisting plaster of Eliza’s room with such force as to send the rod flying on to her bed. I had gone up-stairs alone, and I confess the thing puzzled me: in two or three places in the wall small apertures had been made, none of them of any depth. Not the least mysterious thing was the disappearance of the iron implement that had been used.  I remembered a story I read once about an impish dwarf that lived in the spaces between the double walls of an ancient castle. I wondered vaguely if my original idea of a secret entrance to a hidden chamber could be right, after all, and if we were housing some erratic guest, who played pranks on us in the dark, and destroyed the walls that he might listen, hidden safely away, to our amazed investigations.  Mary Anne and Eliza left that afternoon, but Rosie decided to stay. It was about five o’clock when the hack came from the station to get them, and, to my amazement, it had an occupant. Matthew Geist, the driver, asked for me, and explained his errand with pride.  “I’ve brought you a cook, Miss Innes,” he said. “When the message came to come up for two girls and their trunks, I supposed there was something doing, and as this here woman had been looking for work in the village, I thought I’d bring her along.”  Already I had acquired the true suburbanite ability to take servants on faith; I no longer demanded written and unimpeachable references. I, Rachel Innes, have learned not to mind if the cook sits down comfortably in my sitting-room when she is taking the orders for the day, and I am grateful if the silver is not cleaned with scouring soap. And so that day I merely told Liddy to send the new applicant in. When she came, however, I could hardly restrain a gasp of surprise. It was the woman with the pitted face.  She stood somewhat awkwardly just inside the door, and she had an air of self-confidence that was inspiring. Yes, she could cook; was not a fancy cook, but could make good soups and desserts if there was any one to take charge of the salads. And so, in the end, I took her. As Halsey said, when we told him, it didn’t matter much about the cook’s face, if it was clean.  I have spoken of Halsey’s restlessness. On that day it seemed to be more than ever a resistless impulse that kept him out until after luncheon. I think he hoped constantly that he might meet Louise driving over the hills in her runabout: possibly he did meet her occasionally, but from his continued gloom I felt sure the situation between them was unchanged.  Part of the afternoon I believe he read—Gertrude and I were out, as I have said, and at dinner we both noticed that something had occurred to distract him. He was disagreeable, which is unlike him, nervous, looking at his watch every few minutes, and he ate almost nothing. He asked twice during the meal on what train Mr. Jamieson and the other detective were coming, and had long periods of abstraction during which he dug his fork into my damask cloth and did not hear when he was spoken to. He refused dessert, and left the table early, excusing himself on the ground that he wanted to see Alex.  Alex, however, was not to be found. It was after eight when Halsey ordered the car, and started down the hill at a pace that, even for him, was unusually reckless. Shortly after, Alex reported that he was ready to go over the house, preparatory to closing it for the night. Sam Bohannon came at a quarter before nine, and began his patrol of the grounds, and with the arrival of the two detectives to look forward to, I was not especially apprehensive.  At half-past nine I heard the sound of a horse driven furiously up the drive. It came to a stop in front of the house, and immediately after there were hurried steps on the veranda. Our nerves were not what they should have been, and Gertrude, always apprehensive lately, was at the door almost instantly. A moment later Louise had burst into the room and stood there bareheaded and breathing hard!  “Where is Halsey?” she demanded. Above her plain black gown her eyes looked big and somber, and the rapid drive had brought no color to her face. I got up and drew forward a chair.  “He has not come back,” I said quietly. “Sit down, child; you are not strong enough for this kind of thing.”  I don’t think she even heard me.  “He has not come back?” she asked, looking from me to Gertrude. “Do you know where he went? Where can I find him?”  “For Heaven’s sake, Louise,” Gertrude burst out, “tell us what is wrong. Halsey is not here. He has gone to the station for Mr. Jamieson. What has happened?”  “To the station, Gertrude? You are sure?”  “Yes,” I said. “Listen. There is the whistle of the train now.”  She relaxed a little at our matter-of-fact tone, and allowed herself to sink into a chair.  “Perhaps I was wrong,” she said heavily. “He—will be here in a few moments if—everything is right.”  We sat there, the three of us, without attempt at conversation. Both Gertrude and I recognized the futility of asking Louise any questions: her reticence was a part of a role she had assumed. Our ears were strained for the first throb of the motor as it turned into the drive and commenced the climb to the house. Ten minutes passed, fifteen, twenty. I saw Louise’s hands grow rigid as they clutched the arms of her chair. I watched Gertrude’s bright color slowly ebbing away, and around my own heart I seemed to feel the grasp of a giant hand.  Twenty-five minutes, and then a sound. But it was not the chug of the motor: it was the unmistakable rumble of the Casanova hack. Gertrude drew aside the curtain and peered into the darkness.  “It’s the hack, I am sure,” she said, evidently relieved. “Something has gone wrong with the car, and no wonder—the way Halsey went down the hill.”  It seemed a long time before the creaking vehicle came to a stop at the door. Louise rose and stood watching, her hand to her throat. And then Gertrude opened the door, admitting Mr. Jamieson and a stocky, middle-aged man. Halsey was not with them. When the door had closed and Louise realized that Halsey had not come, her expression changed. From tense watchfulness to relief, and now again to absolute despair, her face was an open page.  “Halsey?” I asked unceremoniously, ignoring the stranger. “Did he not meet you?”  “No.” Mr. Jamieson looked slightly surprised. “I rather expected the car, but we got up all right.”  “You didn’t see him at all?” Louise demanded breathlessly.  Mr. Jamieson knew her at once, although he had not seen her before. She had kept to her rooms until the morning she left.  “No, Miss Armstrong,” he said. “I saw nothing of him. What is wrong?”  “Then we shall have to find him,” she asserted. “Every instant is precious. Mr. Jamieson, I have reason for believing that he is in danger, but I don’t know what it is. Only—he must be found.”  The stocky man had said nothing. Now, however, he went quickly toward the door.  “I’ll catch the hack down the road and hold it,” he said. “Is the gentleman down in the town?”  “Mr. Jamieson,” Louise said impulsively, “I can use the hack. Take my horse and trap outside and drive like mad. Try to find the Dragon Fly—it ought to be easy to trace. I can think of no other way. Only, don’t lose a moment.”  The new detective had gone, and a moment later Jamieson went rapidly down the drive, the cob’s feet striking fire at every step. Louise stood looking after them. When she turned around she faced Gertrude, who stood indignant, almost tragic, in the hall.  “You KNOW what threatens Halsey, Louise,” she said accusingly. “I believe you know this whole horrible thing, this mystery that we are struggling with. If anything happens to Halsey, I shall never forgive you.”  Louise only raised her hands despairingly and dropped them again.  “He is as dear to me as he is to you,” she said sadly. “I tried to warn him.”  “Nonsense!” I said, as briskly as I could. “We are making a lot of trouble out of something perhaps very small. Halsey was probably late—he is always late. Any moment we may hear the car coming up the road.”  But it did not come. After a half-hour of suspense, Louise went out quietly, and did not come back. I hardly knew she was gone until I heard the station hack moving off. At eleven o’clock the telephone rang. It was Mr. Jamieson.  “I have found the Dragon Fly, Miss Innes,” he said. “It has collided with a freight car on the siding above the station. No, Mr. Innes was not there, but we shall probably find him. Send Warner for the car.”  But they did not find him. At four o’clock the next morning we were still waiting for news, while Alex watched the house and Sam the grounds. At daylight I dropped into exhausted sleep. Halsey had not come back, and there was no word from the detective.     CHAPTER XXVI. HALSEY’S DISAPPEARANCE   Nothing that had gone before had been as bad as this. The murder and Thomas’ sudden death we had been able to view in a detached sort of way. But with Halsey’s disappearance everything was altered. Our little circle, intact until now, was broken. We were no longer onlookers who saw a battle passing around them. We were the center of action. Of course, there was no time then to voice such an idea. My mind seemed able to hold only one thought: that Halsey had been foully dealt with, and that every minute lost might be fatal.  Mr. Jamieson came back about eight o’clock the next morning: he was covered with mud, and his hat was gone. Altogether, we were a sad-looking trio that gathered around a breakfast that no one could eat. Over a cup of black coffee the detective told us what he had learned of Halsey’s movements the night before. Up to a certain point the car had made it easy enough to follow him. And I gathered that Mr. Burns, the other detective, had followed a similar car for miles at dawn, only to find it was a touring car on an endurance run.  “He left here about ten minutes after eight,” Mr. Jamieson said. “He went alone, and at eight twenty he stopped at Doctor Walker’s. I went to the doctor’s about midnight, but he had been called out on a case, and had not come back at four o’clock. From the doctor’s it seems Mr. Innes walked across the lawn to the cottage Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter have taken. Mrs. Armstrong had retired, and he said perhaps a dozen words to Miss Louise. She will not say what they were, but the girl evidently suspects what has occurred. That is, she suspects foul play, but she doesn’t know of what nature. Then, apparently, he started directly for the station. He was going very fast—the flagman at the Carol Street crossing says he saw the car pass. He knew the siren. Along somewhere in the dark stretch between Carol Street and the depot he evidently swerved suddenly—perhaps some one in the road—and went full into the side of a freight. We found it there last night.”  “He might have been thrown under the train by the force of the shock,” I said tremulously.  Gertrude shuddered.  “We examined every inch of track. There was—no sign.”  “But surely—he can’t be—gone!” I cried. “Aren’t there traces in the mud—anything?”  “There is no mud—only dust. There has been no rain. And the footpath there is of cinders. Miss Innes, I am inclined to think that he has met with bad treatment, in the light of what has gone before. I do not think he has been murdered.” I shrank from the word. “Burns is back in the country, on a clue we got from the night clerk at the drug-store. There will be two more men here by noon, and the city office is on the lookout.”  “The creek?” Gertrude asked.  “The creek is shallow now. If it were swollen with rain, it would be different. There is hardly any water in it. Now, Miss Innes,” he said, turning to me, “I must ask you some questions. Had Mr. Halsey any possible reason for going away like this, without warning?”  “None whatever.”  “He went away once before,” he persisted. “And you were as sure then.”  “He did not leave the Dragon Fly jammed into the side of a freight car before.”  “No, but he left it for repairs in a blacksmith shop, a long distance from here. Do you know if he had any enemies? Any one who might wish him out of the way?”  “Not that I know of, unless—no, I can not think of any.”  “Was he in the habit of carrying money?”  “He never carried it far. No, he never had more than enough for current expenses.”  Mr. Jamieson got up then and began to pace the room. It was an unwonted concession to the occasion.  “Then I think we get at it by elimination. The chances are against flight. If he was hurt, we find no trace of him. It looks almost like an abduction. This young Doctor Walker—have you any idea why Mr. Innes should have gone there last night?”  “I can not understand it,” Gertrude said thoughtfully. “I don’t think he knew Doctor Walker at all, and—their relations could hardly have been cordial, under the circumstances.”  Jamieson pricked up his ears, and little by little he drew from us the unfortunate story of Halsey’s love affair, and the fact that Louise was going to marry Doctor Walker.  Mr. Jamieson listened attentively.  “There are some interesting developments here,” he said thoughtfully. “The woman who claims to be the mother of Lucien Wallace has not come back. Your nephew has apparently been spirited away. There is an organized attempt being made to enter this house; in fact, it has been entered. Witness the incident with the cook yesterday. And I have a new piece of information.”  He looked carefully away from Gertrude. “Mr. John Bailey is not at his Knickerbocker apartments, and I don’t know where he is. It’s a hash, that’s what it is. It’s a Chinese puzzle. They won’t fit together, unless—unless Mr. Bailey and your nephew have again—”  And once again Gertrude surprised me. “They are not together,” she said hotly. “I—know where Mr. Bailey is, and my brother is not with him.”  The detective turned and looked at her keenly.  “Miss Gertrude,” he said, “if you and Miss Louise would only tell me everything you know and surmise about this business, I should be able to do a great many things. I believe I could find your brother, and I might be able to—well, to do some other things.” But Gertrude’s glance did not falter.  “Nothing that I know could help you to find Halsey,” she said stubbornly. “I know absolutely as little of his disappearance as you do, and I can only say this: I do not trust Doctor Walker. I think he hated Halsey, and he would get rid of him if he could.”  “Perhaps you are right. In fact, I had some such theory myself. But Doctor Walker went out late last night to a serious case in Summitville, and is still there. Burns traced him there. We have made guarded inquiry at the Greenwood Club, and through the village. There is absolutely nothing to go on but this. On the embankment above the railroad, at the point where we found the machine, is a small house. An old woman and a daughter, who is very lame, live there. They say that they distinctly heard the shock when the Dragon Fly hit the car, and they went to the bottom of their garden and looked over. The automobile was there; they could see the lights, and they thought someone had been injured. It was very dark, but they could make out two figures, standing together. The women were curious, and, leaving the fence, they went back and by a roundabout path down to the road. When they got there the car was still standing, the headlight broken and the bonnet crushed, but there was no one to be seen.”  The detective went away immediately, and to Gertrude and me was left the woman’s part, to watch and wait. By luncheon nothing had been found, and I was frantic. I went up-stairs to Halsey’s room finally, from sheer inability to sit across from Gertrude any longer, and meet her terror-filled eyes.  Liddy was in my dressing-room, suspiciously red-eyed, and trying to put a right sleeve in a left armhole of a new waist for me. I was too much shaken to scold.  “What name did that woman in the kitchen give?” she demanded, viciously ripping out the offending sleeve.  “Bliss. Mattie Bliss,” I replied.  “Bliss. M. B. Well, that’s not what she has on he suitcase. It is marked N. F. C.”  The new cook and her initials troubled me not at all. I put on my bonnet and sent for what the Casanova liveryman called a “stylish turnout.” Having once made up my mind to a course of action, I am not one to turn back. Warner drove me; he was plainly disgusted, and he steered the livery horse as he would the Dragon Fly, feeling uneasily with his left foot for the clutch, and working his right elbow at an imaginary horn every time a dog got in the way.  Warner had something on his mind, and after we had turned into the road, he voiced it.  “Miss Innes,” he said. “I overheard a part of a conversation yesterday that I didn’t understand. It wasn’t my business to understand it, for that matter. But I’ve been thinking all day that I’d better tell you. Yesterday afternoon, while you and Miss Gertrude were out driving, I had got the car in some sort of shape again after the fire, and I went to the library to call Mr. Innes to see it. I went into the living-room, where Miss Liddy said he was, and half-way across to the library I heard him talking to some one. He seemed to be walking up and down, and he was in a rage, I can tell you.”  “What did he say?”  “The first thing I heard was—excuse me, Miss Innes, but it’s what he said, ‘The damned rascal,’ he said, ‘I’ll see him in’—well, in hell was what he said, ‘in hell first.’ Then somebody else spoke up; it was a woman. She said, ‘I warned them, but they thought I would be afraid.’”  “A woman! Did you wait to see who it was?”  “I wasn’t spying, Miss Innes,” Warner said with dignity. “But the next thing caught my attention. She said, ‘I knew there was something wrong from the start. A man isn’t well one day, and dead the next, without some reason.’ I thought she was speaking of Thomas.”  “And you don’t know who it was!” I exclaimed. “Warner, you had the key to this whole occurrence in your hands, and did not use it!”  However, there was nothing to be done. I resolved to make inquiry when I got home, and in the meantime, my present errand absorbed me. This was nothing less than to see Louise Armstrong, and to attempt to drag from her what she knew, or suspected, of Halsey’s disappearance. But here, as in every direction I turned, I was baffled.  A neat maid answered the bell, but she stood squarely in the doorway, and it was impossible to preserve one’s dignity and pass her.  “Miss Armstrong is very ill, and unable to see any one,” she said. I did not believe her.  “And Mrs. Armstrong—is she also ill?”  “She is with Miss Louise and can not be disturbed.”  “Tell her it is Miss Innes, and that it is a matter of the greatest importance.”  “It would be of no use, Miss Innes. My orders are positive.”  At that moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs. Past the maid’s white-strapped shoulder I could see a familiar thatch of gray hair, and in a moment I was face to face with Doctor Stewart. He was very grave, and his customary geniality was tinged with restraint.  “You are the very woman I want to see,” he said promptly. “Send away your trap, and let me drive you home. What is this about your nephew?”  “He has disappeared, doctor. Not only that, but there is every evidence that he has been either abducted, or—” I could not finish. The doctor helped me into his capacious buggy in silence. Until we had got a little distance he did not speak; then he turned and looked at me.  “Now tell me about it,” he said. He heard me through without speaking.  “And you think Louise knows something?” he said when I had finished. “I don’t—in fact, I am sure of it. The best evidence of it is this: she asked me if he had been heard from, or if anything had been learned. She won’t allow Walker in the room, and she made me promise to see you and tell you this: don’t give up the search for him. Find him, and find him soon. He is living.”  “Well,” I said, “if she knows that, she knows more. She is a very cruel and ungrateful girl.”  “She is a very sick girl,” he said gravely. “Neither you nor I can judge her until we know everything. Both she and her mother are ghosts of their former selves. Under all this, these two sudden deaths, this bank robbery, the invasions at Sunnyside and Halsey’s disappearance, there is some mystery that, mark my words, will come out some day. And when it does, we shall find Louise Armstrong a victim.”  I had not noticed where we were going, but now I saw we were beside the railroad, and from a knot of men standing beside the track I divined that it was here the car had been found. The siding, however, was empty. Except a few bits of splintered wood on the ground, there was no sign of the accident.  “Where is the freight car that was rammed?” the doctor asked a bystander.  “It was taken away at daylight, when the train was moved.”  There was nothing to be gained. He pointed out the house on the embankment where the old lady and her daughter had heard the crash and seen two figures beside the car. Then we drove slowly home. I had the doctor put me down at the gate, and I walked to the house—past the lodge where we had found Louise, and, later, poor Thomas; up the drive where I had seen a man watching the lodge and where, later, Rosie had been frightened; past the east entrance, where so short a time before the most obstinate effort had been made to enter the house, and where, that night two weeks ago, Liddy and I had seen the strange woman. Not far from the west wing lay the blackened ruins of the stables. I felt like a ruin myself, as I paused on the broad veranda before I entered the house.  Two private detectives had arrived in my absence, and it was a relief to turn over to them the responsibility of the house and grounds. Mr. Jamieson, they said, had arranged for more to assist in the search for the missing man, and at that time the country was being scoured in all directions.  The household staff was again depleted that afternoon. Liddy was waiting to tell me that the new cook had gone, bag and baggage, without waiting to be paid. No one had admitted the visitor whom Warner had heard in the library, unless, possibly, the missing cook. Again I was working in a circle.     CHAPTER XXVII. WHO IS NINA CARRINGTON?   The four days, from Saturday to the following Tuesday, we lived, or existed, in a state of the most dreadful suspense. We ate only when Liddy brought in a tray, and then very little. The papers, of course, had got hold of the story, and we were besieged by newspaper men. From all over the country false clues came pouring in and raised hopes that crumbled again to nothing. Every morgue within a hundred miles, every hospital, had been visited, without result.  Mr. Jamieson, personally, took charge of the organized search, and every evening, no matter where he happened to be, he called us by long distance telephone. It was the same formula. “Nothing to-day. A new clue to work on. Better luck to-morrow.”  And heartsick we would put up the receiver and sit down again to our vigil.  The inaction was deadly. Liddy cried all day, and, because she knew I objected to tears, sniffled audibly around the corner.  “For Heaven’s sake, smile!” I snapped at her. And her ghastly attempt at a grin, with her swollen nose and red eyes, made me hysterical. I laughed and cried together, and pretty soon, like the two old fools we were, we were sitting together weeping into the same handkerchief.  Things were happening, of course, all the time, but they made little or no impression. The Charity Hospital called up Doctor Stewart and reported that Mrs. Watson was in a critical condition. I understood also that legal steps were being taken to terminate my lease at Sunnyside. Louise was out of danger, but very ill, and a trained nurse guarded her like a gorgon. There was a rumor in the village, brought up by Liddy from the butcher’s, that a wedding had already taken place between Louise and Doctor Walker and this roused me for the first time to action.  On Tuesday, then, I sent for the car, and prepared to go out. As I waited at the porte-cochere I saw the under-gardener, an inoffensive, grayish-haired man, trimming borders near the house.  The day detective was watching him, sitting on the carriage block. When he saw me, he got up.  “Miss Innes,” he said, taking of his hat, “do you know where Alex, the gardener, is?”  “Why, no. Isn’t he here?” I asked.  “He has been gone since yesterday afternoon. Have you employed him long?”  “Only a couple of weeks.”  “Is he efficient? A capable man?”  “I hardly know,” I said vaguely. “The place looks all right, and I know very little about such things. I know much more about boxes of roses than bushes of them.”  “This man,” pointing to the assistant, “says Alex isn’t a gardener. That he doesn’t know anything about plants.”  “That’s very strange,” I said, thinking hard. “Why, he came to me from the Brays, who are in Europe.”  “Exactly.” The detective smiled. “Every man who cuts grass isn’t a gardener, Miss Innes, and just now it is our policy to believe every person around here a rascal until he proves to be the other thing.”  Warner came up with the car then, and the conversation stopped. As he helped me in, however, the detective said something further.  “Not a word or sign to Alex, if he comes back,” he said cautiously.  I went first to Doctor Walker’s. I was tired of beating about the bush, and I felt that the key to Halsey’s disappearance was here at Casanova, in spite of Mr. Jamieson’s theories.  The doctor was in. He came at once to the door of his consulting-room, and there was no mask of cordiality in his manner.  “Please come in,” he said curtly.  “I shall stay here, I think, doctor.” I did not like his face or his manner; there was a subtle change in both. He had thrown off the air of friendliness, and I thought, too, that he looked anxious and haggard.  “Doctor Walker,” I said, “I have come to you to ask some questions. I hope you will answer them. As you know, my nephew has not yet been found.”  “So I understand,” stiffly.  “I believe, if you would, you could help us, and that leads to one of my questions. Will you tell me what was the nature of the conversation you held with him the night he was attacked and carried off?”  “Attacked! Carried off!” he said, with pretended surprise. “Really, Miss Innes, don’t you think you exaggerate? I understand it is not the first time Mr. Innes has—disappeared.”  “You are quibbling, doctor. This is a matter of life and death. Will you answer my question?”  “Certainly. He said his nerves were bad, and I gave him a prescription for them. I am violating professional ethics when I tell you even as much as that.”  I could not tell him he lied. I think I looked it. But I hazarded a random shot.  “I thought perhaps,” I said, watching him narrowly, “that it might be about—Nina Carrington.”  For a moment I thought he was going to strike me. He grew livid, and a small crooked blood-vessel in his temple swelled and throbbed curiously. Then he forced a short laugh.  “Who is Nina Carrington?” he asked.  “I am about to discover that,” I replied, and he was quiet at once. It was not difficult to divine that he feared Nina Carrington a good deal more than he did the devil. Our leave-taking was brief; in fact, we merely stared at each other over the waiting-room table, with its litter of year-old magazines. Then I turned and went out.  “To Richfield,” I told Warner, and on the way I thought, and thought hard.  “Nina Carrington, Nina Carrington,” the roar and rush of the wheels seemed to sing the words. “Nina Carrington, N. C.” And I then knew, knew as surely as if I had seen the whole thing. There had been an N. C. on the suit-case belonging to the woman with the pitted face. How simple it all seemed. Mattie Bliss had been Nina Carrington. It was she Warner had heard in the library. It was something she had told Halsey that had taken him frantically to Doctor Walker’s office, and from there perhaps to his death. If we could find the woman, we might find what had become of Halsey.  We were almost at Richfield now, so I kept on. My mind was not on my errand there now. It was back with Halsey on that memorable night. What was it he had said to Louise, that had sent her up to Sunnyside, half wild with fear for him? I made up my mind, as the car drew up before the Tate cottage, that I would see Louise if I had to break into the house at night.  Almost exactly the same scene as before greeted my eyes at the cottage. Mrs. Tate, the baby-carriage in the path, the children at the swing—all were the same.  She came forward to meet me, and I noticed that some of the anxious lines had gone out of her face. She looked young, almost pretty.  “I am glad you have come back,” she said. “I think I will have to be honest and give you back your money.”  “Why?” I asked. “Has the mother come?”  “No, but some one came and paid the boy’s board for a month. She talked to him for a long time, but when I asked him afterward he didn’t know her name.”  “A young woman?”  “Not very young. About forty, I suppose. She was small and fair-haired, just a little bit gray, and very sad. She was in deep mourning, and, I think, when she came, she expected to go at once. But the child, Lucien, interested her. She talked to him for a long time, and, indeed, she looked much happier when she left.”  “You are sure this was not the real mother?”  “O mercy, no! Why, she didn’t know which of the three was Lucien. I thought perhaps she was a friend of yours, but, of course, I didn’t ask.”  “She was not—pock-marked?” I asked at a venture.  “No, indeed. A skin like a baby’s. But perhaps you will know the initials. She gave Lucien a handkerchief and forgot it. It was very fine, black-bordered, and it had three hand-worked letters in the corner—F. B. A.”  “No,” I said with truth enough, “she is not a friend of mine.” F. B. A. was Fanny Armstrong, without a chance of doubt!  With another warning to Mrs. Tate as to silence, we started back to Sunnyside. So Fanny Armstrong knew of Lucien Wallace, and was sufficiently interested to visit him and pay for his support. Who was the child’s mother and where was she? Who was Nina Carrington? Did either of them know where Halsey was or what had happened to him?  On the way home we passed the little cemetery where Thomas had been laid to rest. I wondered if Thomas could have helped us to find Halsey, had he lived. Farther along was the more imposing burial-ground, where Arnold Armstrong and his father lay in the shadow of a tall granite shaft. Of the three, I think Thomas was the only one sincerely mourned.     CHAPTER XXVIII. A TRAMP AND THE TOOTHACHE   The bitterness toward the dead president of the Traders’ Bank seemed to grow with time. Never popular, his memory was execrated by people who had lost nothing, but who were filled with disgust by constantly hearing new stories of the man’s grasping avarice. The Traders’ had been a favorite bank for small tradespeople, and in its savings department it had solicited the smallest deposits. People who had thought to be self-supporting to the last found themselves confronting the poorhouse, their two or three hundred dollar savings wiped away. All bank failures have this element, however, and the directors were trying to promise twenty per cent. on deposits.  But, like everything else those days, the bank failure was almost forgotten by Gertrude and myself. We did not mention Jack Bailey: I had found nothing to change my impression of his guilt, and Gertrude knew how I felt. As for the murder of the bank president’s son, I was of two minds. One day I thought Gertrude knew or at least suspected that Jack had done it; the next I feared that it had been Gertrude herself, that night alone on the circular staircase. And then the mother of Lucien Wallace would obtrude herself, and an almost equally good case might be made against her. There were times, of course, when I was disposed to throw all those suspicions aside, and fix definitely on the unknown, whoever that might be.  I had my greatest disappointment when it came to tracing Nina Carrington. The woman had gone without leaving a trace. Marked as she was, it should have been easy to follow her, but she was not to be found. A description to one of the detectives, on my arrival at home, had started the ball rolling. But by night she had not been found. I told Gertrude, then, about the telegram to Louise when she had been ill before; about my visit to Doctor Walker, and my suspicions that Mattie Bliss and Nina Carrington were the same. She thought, as I did, that there was little doubt of it.  I said nothing to her, however, of the detective’s suspicions about Alex. Little things that I had not noticed at the time now came back to me. I had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps Alex was a spy, and that by taking him into the house I had played into the enemy’s hand. But at eight o’clock that night Alex himself appeared, and with him a strange and repulsive individual. They made a queer pair, for Alex was almost as disreputable as the tramp, and he had a badly swollen eye.  Gertrude had been sitting listlessly waiting for the evening message from Mr. Jamieson, but when the singular pair came in, as they did, without ceremony, she jumped up and stood staring. Winters, the detective who watched the house at night, followed them, and kept his eyes sharply on Alex’s prisoner. For that was the situation as it developed.  He was a tall lanky individual, ragged and dirty, and just now he looked both terrified and embarrassed. Alex was too much engrossed to be either, and to this day I don’t think I ever asked him why he went off without permission the day before.  “Miss Innes,” Alex began abruptly, “this man can tell us something very important about the disappearance of Mr. Innes. I found him trying to sell this watch.”  He took a watch from his pocket and put it on the table. It was Halsey’s watch. I had given it to him on his twenty-first birthday: I was dumb with apprehension.  “He says he had a pair of cuff-links also, but he sold them—”  “Fer a dollar’n half,” put in the disreputable individual hoarsely, with an eye on the detective.  “He is not—dead?” I implored. The tramp cleared his throat.  “No’m,” he said huskily. “He was used up pretty bad, but he weren’t dead. He was comin’ to hisself when I”—he stopped and looked at the detective. “I didn’t steal it, Mr. Winters,” he whined. “I found it in the road, honest to God, I did.”  Mr. Winters paid no attention to him. He was watching Alex.  “I’d better tell what he told me,” Alex broke in. “It will be quicker. When Jamieson—when Mr. Jamieson calls up we can start him right. Mr. Winters, I found this man trying to sell that watch on Fifth Street. He offered it to me for three dollars.”  “How did you know the watch?” Winters snapped at him.  “I had seen it before, many times. I used it at night when I was watching at the foot of the staircase.” The detective was satisfied. “When he offered the watch to me, I knew it, and I pretended I was going to buy it. We went into an alley and I got the watch.” The tramp shivered. It was plain how Alex had secured the watch. “Then—I got the story from this fellow. He claims to have seen the whole affair. He says he was in an empty car—in the car the automobile struck.”  The tramp broke in here, and told his story, with frequent interpretations by Alex and Mr. Winters. He used a strange medley, in which familiar words took unfamiliar meanings, but it was gradually made clear to us.  On the night in question the tramp had been “pounding his ear”—this stuck to me as being graphic—in an empty box-car along the siding at Casanova. The train was going west, and due to leave at dawn. The tramp and the “brakey” were friendly, and things going well. About ten o’clock, perhaps earlier, a terrific crash against the side of the car roused him. He tried to open the door, but could not move it. He got out of the other side, and just as he did so, he heard some one groan.  The habits of a lifetime made him cautious. He slipped on to the bumper of a car and peered through. An automobile had struck the car, and stood there on two wheels. The tail lights were burning, but the headlights were out. Two men were stooping over some one who lay on the ground. Then the taller of the two started on a dog-trot along the train looking for an empty. He found one four cars away and ran back again. The two lifted the unconscious man into the empty box-car, and, getting in themselves, stayed for three or four minutes. When they came out, after closing the sliding door, they cut up over the railroad embankment toward the town. One, the short one, seemed to limp.  The tramp was wary. He waited for ten minutes or so. Some women came down a path to the road and inspected the automobile. When they had gone, he crawled into the box-car and closed the door again. Then he lighted a match. The figure of a man, unconscious, gagged, and with his hands tied, lay far at the end.  The tramp lost no time; he went through his pockets, found a little money and the cuff-links, and took them. Then he loosened the gag—it had been cruelly tight—and went his way, again closing the door of the box-car. Outside on the road he found the watch. He got on the fast freight east, some time after, and rode into the city. He had sold the cuff-links, but on offering the watch to Alex he had been “copped.”  The story, with its cold recital of villainy, was done. I hardly knew if I were more anxious, or less. That it was Halsey, there could be no doubt. How badly he was hurt, how far he had been carried, were the questions that demanded immediate answer. But it was the first real information we had had; my boy had not been murdered outright. But instead of vague terrors there was now the real fear that he might be lying in some strange hospital receiving the casual attention commonly given to the charity cases. Even this, had we known it, would have been paradise to the terrible truth. I wake yet and feel myself cold and trembling with the horror of Halsey’s situation for three days after his disappearance.  Mr. Winters and Alex disposed of the tramp with a warning. It was evident he had told us all he knew. We had occasion, within a day or two, to be doubly thankful that we had given him his freedom. When Mr. Jamieson telephoned that night we had news for him; he told me what I had not realized before—that it would not be possible to find Halsey at once, even with this clue. The cars by this time, three days, might be scattered over the Union.  But he said to keep on hoping, that it was the best news we had had. And in the meantime, consumed with anxiety as we were, things were happening at the house in rapid succession.  We had one peaceful day—then Liddy took sick in the night. I went in when I heard her groaning, and found her with a hot-water bottle to her face, and her right cheek swollen until it was glassy.  “Toothache?” I asked, not too gently. “You deserve it. A woman of your age, who would rather go around with an exposed nerve in her head than have the tooth pulled! It would be over in a moment.”  “So would hanging,” Liddy protested, from behind the hot-water bottle.  I was hunting around for cotton and laudanum.  “You have a tooth just like it yourself, Miss Rachel,” she whimpered. “And I’m sure Doctor Boyle’s been trying to take it out for years.”  There was no laudanum, and Liddy made a terrible fuss when I proposed carbolic acid, just because I had put too much on the cotton once and burned her mouth. I’m sure it never did her any permanent harm; indeed, the doctor said afterward that living on liquid diet had been a splendid rest for her stomach. But she would have none of the acid, and she kept me awake groaning, so at last I got up and went to Gertrude’s door. To my surprise, it was locked.  I went around by the hall and into her bedroom that way. The bed was turned down, and her dressing-gown and night-dress lay ready in the little room next, but Gertrude was not there. She had not undressed.  I don’t know what terrible thoughts came to me in the minute I stood there. Through the door I could hear Liddy grumbling, with a squeal now and then when the pain stabbed harder. Then, automatically, I got the laudanum and went back to her.  It was fully a half-hour before Liddy’s groans subsided. At intervals I went to the door into the hall and looked out, but I saw and heard nothing suspicious. Finally, when Liddy had dropped into a doze, I even ventured as far as the head of the circular staircase, but there floated up to me only the even breathing of Winters, the night detective, sleeping just inside the entry. And then, far off, I heard the rapping noise that had lured Louise down the staircase that other night, two weeks before. It was over my head, and very faint—three or four short muffled taps, a pause, and then again, stealthily repeated.  The sound of Mr. Winters’ breathing was comforting; with the thought that there was help within call, something kept me from waking him. I did not move for a moment; ridiculous things Liddy had said about a ghost—I am not at all superstitious, except, perhaps, in the middle of the night, with everything dark—things like that came back to me. Almost beside me was the clothes chute. I could feel it, but I could see nothing. As I stood, listening intently, I heard a sound near me. It was vague, indefinite. Then it ceased; there was an uneasy movement and a grunt from the foot of the circular staircase, and silence again.  I stood perfectly still, hardly daring to breathe.  Then I knew I had been right. Some one was stealthily passing the head of the staircase and coming toward me in the dark. I leaned against the wall for support—my knees were giving way. The steps were close now, and suddenly I thought of Gertrude. Of course it was Gertrude. I put out one hand in front of me, but I touched nothing. My voice almost refused me, but I managed to gasp out, “Gertrude!”  “Good Lord!” a man’s voice exclaimed, just beside me. And then I collapsed. I felt myself going, felt some one catch me, a horrible nausea—that was all I remembered.  When I came to it was dawn. I was lying on the bed in Louise’s room, with the cherub on the ceiling staring down at me, and there was a blanket from my own bed thrown over me. I felt weak and dizzy, but I managed to get up and totter to the door. At the foot of the circular staircase Mr. Winters was still asleep. Hardly able to stand, I crept back to my room. The door into Gertrude’s room was no longer locked: she was sleeping like a tired child. And in my dressing-room Liddy hugged a cold hot-water bottle, and mumbled in her sleep.  “There’s some things you can’t hold with hand cuffs,” she was muttering thickly.     CHAPTER XXIX. A SCRAP OF PAPER   For the first time in twenty years, I kept my bed that day. Liddy was alarmed to the point of hysteria, and sent for Doctor Stewart just after breakfast. Gertrude spent the morning with me, reading something—I forget what. I was too busy with my thoughts to listen. I had said nothing to the two detectives. If Mr. Jamieson had been there, I should have told him everything, but I could not go to these strange men and tell them my niece had been missing in the middle of the night; that she had not gone to bed at all; that while I was searching for her through the house, I had met a stranger who, when I fainted, had carried me into a room and left me there, to get better or not, as it might happen.  The whole situation was terrible: had the issues been less vital, it would have been absurd. Here we were, guarded day and night by private detectives, with an extra man to watch the grounds, and yet we might as well have lived in a Japanese paper house, for all the protection we had.  And there was something else: the man I had met in the darkness had been even more startled than I, and about his voice, when he muttered his muffled exclamation, there was something vaguely familiar. All that morning, while Gertrude read aloud, and Liddy watched for the doctor, I was puzzling over that voice, without result.  And there were other things, too. I wondered what Gertrude’s absence from her room had to do with it all, or if it had any connection. I tried to think that she had heard the rapping noises before I did and gone to investigate, but I’m afraid I was a moral coward that day. I could not ask her.  Perhaps the diversion was good for me. It took my mind from Halsey, and the story we had heard the night before. The day, however, was a long vigil, with every ring of the telephone full of possibilities. Doctor Walker came up, some time just after luncheon, and asked for me.  “Go down and see him,” I instructed Gertrude. “Tell him I am out—for mercy’s sake don’t say I’m sick. Find out what he wants, and from this time on, instruct the servants that he is not to be admitted. I loathe that man.”  Gertrude came back very soon, her face rather flushed.  “He came to ask us to get out,” she said, picking up her book with a jerk. “He says Louise Armstrong wants to come here, now that she is recovering.”  “And what did you say?”  “I said we were very sorry we could not leave, but we would be delighted to have Louise come up here with us. He looked daggers at me. And he wanted to know if we would recommend Eliza as a cook. He has brought a patient, a man, out from town, and is increasing his establishment—that’s the way he put it.”  “I wish him joy of Eliza,” I said tartly. “Did he ask for Halsey?”  “Yes. I told him that we were on the track last night, and that it was only a question of time. He said he was glad, although he didn’t appear to be, but he said not to be too sanguine.”  “Do you know what I believe?” I asked. “I believe, as firmly as I believe anything, that Doctor Walker knows something about Halsey, and that he could put his finger on him, if he wanted to.”  There were several things that day that bewildered me. About three o’clock Mr. Jamieson telephoned from the Casanova station and Warner went down to meet him. I got up and dressed hastily, and the detective was shown up to my sitting-room.  “No news?” I asked, as he entered. He tried to look encouraging, without success. I noticed that he looked tired and dusty, and, although he was ordinarily impeccable in his appearance, it was clear that he was at least two days from a razor.  “It won’t be long now, Miss Innes,” he said. “I have come out here on a peculiar errand, which I will tell you about later. First, I want to ask some questions. Did any one come out here yesterday to repair the telephone, and examine the wires on the roof?”  “Yes,” I said promptly; “but it was not the telephone. He said the wiring might have caused the fire at the stable. I went up with him myself, but he only looked around.”  Mr. Jamieson smiled.  “Good for you!” he applauded. “Don’t allow any one in the house that you don’t trust, and don’t trust anybody. All are not electricians who wear rubber gloves.”  He refused to explain further, but he got a slip of paper out of his pocketbook and opened it carefully.  “Listen,” he said. “You heard this before and scoffed. In the light of recent developments I want you to read it again. You are a clever woman, Miss Innes. Just as surely as I sit here, there is something in this house that is wanted very anxiously by a number of people. The lines are closing up, Miss Innes.”  The paper was the one he had found among Arnold Armstrong’s effects, and I read it again:  “——by altering the plans for——rooms, may be possible. The best way, in my opinion, would be to——the plan for——in one of the——rooms——chimney.”   “I think I understand,” I said slowly. “Some one is searching for the secret room, and the invaders—”  “And the holes in the plaster—”  “Have been in the progress of his—”  “Or her—investigations.”  “Her?” I asked.  “Miss Innes,” the detective said, getting up, “I believe that somewhere in the walls of this house is hidden some of the money, at least, from the Traders’ Bank. I believe, just as surely, that young Walker brought home from California the knowledge of something of the sort and, failing in his effort to reinstall Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter here, he, or a confederate, has tried to break into the house. On two occasions I think he succeeded.”  “On three, at least,” I corrected. And then I told him about the night before. “I have been thinking hard,” I concluded, “and I do not believe the man at the head of the circular staircase was Doctor Walker. I don’t think he could have got in, and the voice was not his.”  Mr. Jamieson got up and paced the floor, his hands behind him.  “There is something else that puzzles me,” he said, stepping before me. “Who and what is the woman Nina Carrington? If it was she who came here as Mattie Bliss, what did she tell Halsey that sent him racing to Doctor Walker’s, and then to Miss Armstrong? If we could find that woman we would have the whole thing.”  “Mr. Jamieson, did you ever think that Paul Armstrong might not have died a natural death?”  “That is the thing we are going to try to find out,” he replied. And then Gertrude came in, announcing a man below to see Mr. Jamieson.  “I want you present at this interview, Miss Innes,” he said. “May Riggs come up? He has left Doctor Walker and he has something he wants to tell us.”  Riggs came into the room diffidently, but Mr. Jamieson put him at his ease. He kept a careful eye on me, however, and slid into a chair by the door when he was asked to sit down.  “Now, Riggs,” began Mr. Jamieson kindly. “You are to say what you have to say before this lady.”  “You promised you’d keep it quiet, Mr. Jamieson.” Riggs plainly did not trust me. There was nothing friendly in the glance he turned on me.  “Yes, yes. You will be protected. But, first of all, did you bring what you promised?”  Riggs produced a roll of papers from under his coat, and handed them over. Mr. Jamieson examined them with lively satisfaction, and passed them to me. “The blue-prints of Sunnyside,” he said. “What did I tell you? Now, Riggs, we are ready.”  “I’d never have come to you, Mr. Jamieson,” he began, “if it hadn’t been for Miss Armstrong. When Mr. Innes was spirited away, like, and Miss Louise got sick because of it, I thought things had gone far enough. I’d done some things for the doctor before that wouldn’t just bear looking into, but I turned a bit squeamish.”  “Did you help with that?” I asked, leaning forward.  “No, ma’m. I didn’t even know of it until the next day, when it came out in the Casanova _Weekly Ledger_. But I know who did it, all right. I’d better start at the beginning.  “When Doctor Walker went away to California with the Armstrong family, there was talk in the town that when he came back he would be married to Miss Armstrong, and we all expected it. First thing I knew, I got a letter from him, in the west. He seemed to be excited, and he said Miss Armstrong had taken a sudden notion to go home and he sent me some money. I was to watch for her, to see if she went to Sunnyside, and wherever she was, not to lose sight of her until he got home. I traced her to the lodge, and I guess I scared you on the drive one night, Miss Innes.”  “And Rosie!” I ejaculated.  Riggs grinned sheepishly.  “I only wanted to make sure Miss Louise was there. Rosie started to run, and I tried to stop her and tell her some sort of a story to account for my being there. But she wouldn’t wait.”  “And the broken china—in the basket?”  “Well, broken china’s death to rubber tires,” he said. “I hadn’t any complaint against you people here, and the Dragon Fly was a good car.”  So Rosie’s highwayman was explained.  “Well, I telegraphed the doctor where Miss Louise was and I kept an eye on her. Just a day or so before they came home with the body, I got another letter, telling me to watch for a woman who had been pitted with smallpox. Her name was Carrington, and the doctor made things pretty strong. If I found any such woman loafing around, I was not to lose sight of her for a minute until the doctor got back.  “Well, I would have had my hands full, but the other woman didn’t show up for a good while, and when she did the doctor was home.”  “Riggs,” I asked suddenly, “did you get into this house a day or two after I took it, at night?”  “I did not, Miss Innes. I have never been in the house before. Well, the Carrington woman didn’t show up until the night Mr. Halsey disappeared. She came to the office late, and the doctor was out. She waited around, walking the floor and working herself into a passion. When the doctor didn’t come back, she was in an awful way. She wanted me to hunt him, and when he didn’t appear, she called him names; said he couldn’t fool her. There was murder being done, and she would see him swing for it.  “She struck me as being an ugly customer, and when she left, about eleven o’clock, and went across to the Armstrong place, I was not far behind her. She walked all around the house first, looking up at the windows. Then she rang the bell, and the minute the door was opened she was through it, and into the hall.”  “How long did she stay?”  “That’s the queer part of it,” Riggs said eagerly. “She didn’t come out that night at all. I went to bed at daylight, and that was the last I heard of her until the next day, when I saw her on a truck at the station, covered with a sheet. She’d been struck by the express and you would hardly have known her—dead, of course. I think she stayed all night in the Armstrong house, and the agent said she was crossing the track to take the up-train to town when the express struck her.”  “Another circle!” I exclaimed. “Then we are just where we started.”  “Not so bad as that, Miss Innes,” Riggs said eagerly. “Nina Carrington came from the town in California where Mr. Armstrong died. Why was the doctor so afraid of her? The Carrington woman knew something. I lived with Doctor Walker seven years, and I know him well. There are few things he is afraid of. I think he killed Mr. Armstrong out in the west somewhere, that’s what I think. What else he did I don’t know—but he dismissed me and pretty nearly throttled me—for telling Mr. Jamieson here about Mr. Innes’ having been at his office the night he disappeared, and about my hearing them quarreling.”  “What was it Warner overheard the woman say to Mr. Innes, in the library?” the detective asked me.  “She said ‘I knew there was something wrong from the start. A man isn’t well one day and dead the next without some reason.’”  How perfectly it all seemed to fit!     CHAPTER XXX. WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN   It was on Wednesday Riggs told us the story of his connection with some incidents that had been previously unexplained. Halsey had been gone since the Friday night before, and with the passage of each day I felt that his chances were lessening. I knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box-car, locked in, perhaps, without water or food. I had read of cases where bodies had been found locked in cars on isolated sidings in the west, and my spirits went down with every hour.  His recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance, and was due directly to the tramp Alex had brought to Sunnyside. It seems the man was grateful for his release, and when he learned something of Halsey’s whereabouts from another member of his fraternity—for it is a fraternity—he was prompt in letting us know.  On Wednesday evening Mr. Jamieson, who had been down at the Armstrong house trying to see Louise—and failing—was met near the gate at Sunnyside by an individual precisely as repulsive and unkempt as the one Alex had captured. The man knew the detective, and he gave him a piece of dirty paper, on which was scrawled the words—“He’s at City Hospital, Johnsville.” The tramp who brought the paper pretended to know nothing, except this: the paper had been passed along from a “hobo” in Johnsville, who seemed to know the information would be valuable to us.  Again the long distance telephone came into requisition. Mr. Jamieson called the hospital, while we crowded around him. And when there was no longer any doubt that it was Halsey, and that he would probably recover, we all laughed and cried together. I am sure I kissed Liddy, and I have had terrible moments since when I seem to remember kissing Mr. Jamieson, too, in the excitement.  Anyhow, by eleven o’clock that night Gertrude was on her way to Johnsville, three hundred and eighty miles away, accompanied by Rosie. The domestic force was now down to Mary Anne and Liddy, with the under-gardener’s wife coming every day to help out. Fortunately, Warner and the detectives were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge. Out of deference to Liddy they washed their dishes once a day, and they concocted queer messes, according to their several abilities. They had one triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast, and that clung to their clothes and their hair the rest of the day. It was bacon, hardtack and onions, fried together. They were almost pathetically grateful, however, I noticed, for an occasional broiled tenderloin.  It was not until Gertrude and Rosie had gone and Sunnyside had settled down for the night, with Winters at the foot of the staircase, that Mr. Jamieson broached a subject he had evidently planned before he came.  “Miss Innes,” he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my room up-stairs, “how are your nerves tonight?”  “I have none,” I said happily. “With Halsey found, my troubles have gone.”  “I mean,” he persisted, “do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual?”  “The most unusual thing I can think of would be a peaceful night. But if anything is going to occur, don’t dare to let me miss it.”  “Something is going to occur,” he said. “And you’re the only woman I can think of that I can take along.” He looked at his watch. “Don’t ask me any questions, Miss Innes. Put on heavy shoes, and some old dark clothes, and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything.”  Liddy was sleeping the sleep of the just when I went up-stairs, and I hunted out my things cautiously. The detective was waiting in the hall, and I was astonished to see Doctor Stewart with him.  They were talking confidentially together, but when I came down they ceased. There were a few preparations to be made: the locks to be gone over, Winters to be instructed as to renewed vigilance, and then, after extinguishing the hall light, we crept, in the darkness, through the front door, and into the night.  I asked no questions. I felt that they were doing me honor in making me one of the party, and I would show them I could be as silent as they. We went across the fields, passing through the woods that reached almost to the ruins of the stable, going over stiles now and then, and sometimes stepping over low fences. Once only somebody spoke, and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from Doctor Stewart when he ran into a wire fence.  We were joined at the end of five minutes by another man, who fell into step with the doctor silently. He carried something over his shoulder which I could not make out. In this way we walked for perhaps twenty minutes. I had lost all sense of direction: I merely stumbled along in silence, allowing Mr. Jamieson to guide me this way or that as the path demanded. I hardly know what I expected. Once, when through a miscalculation I jumped a little short over a ditch and landed above my shoe-tops in the water and ooze, I remember wondering if this were really I, and if I had ever tasted life until that summer. I walked along with the water sloshing in my boots, and I was actually cheerful. I remember whispering to Mr. Jamieson that I had never seen the stars so lovely, and that it was a mistake, when the Lord had made the night so beautiful, to sleep through it!  The doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt. I confess that just at that minute even Sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot. We had paused at the edge of a level cleared place, bordered all around with primly trimmed evergreen trees. Between them I caught a glimpse of starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional more imposing monument, or towering shaft. In spite of myself, I drew my breath in sharply. We were on the edge of the Casanova churchyard.  I saw now both the man who had joined the party and the implements he carried. It was Alex, armed with two long-handled spades. After the first shock of surprise, I flatter myself I was both cool and quiet. We went in single file between the rows of headstones, and although, when I found myself last, I had an instinctive desire to keep looking back over my shoulder, I found that, the first uneasiness past, a cemetery at night is much the same as any other country place, filled with vague shadows and unexpected noises. Once, indeed—but Mr. Jamieson said it was an owl, and I tried to believe him.  In the shadow of the Armstrong granite shaft we stopped. I think the doctor wanted to send me back.  “It’s no place for a woman,” I heard him protesting angrily. But the detective said something about witnesses, and the doctor only came over and felt my pulse.  “Anyhow, I don’t believe you’re any worse off here than you would be in that nightmare of a house,” he said finally, and put his coat on the steps of the shaft for me to sit on.  There is an air of finality about a grave: one watches the earth thrown in, with the feeling that this is the end. Whatever has gone before, whatever is to come in eternity, that particular temple of the soul has been given back to the elements from which it came. Thus, there is a sense of desecration, of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of things, in resurrecting a body from its mother clay. And yet that night, in the Casanova churchyard, I sat quietly by, and watched Alex and Mr. Jamieson steaming over their work, without a single qualm, except the fear of detection.  The doctor kept a keen lookout, but no one appeared. Once in a while he came over to me, and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder.  “I never expected to come to this,” he said once. “There’s one thing sure—I’ll not be suspected of complicity. A doctor is generally supposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging them up.”  The uncanny moment came when Alex and Jamieson tossed the spades on the grass, and I confess I hid my face. There was a period of stress, I think, while the heavy coffin was being raised. I felt that my composure was going, and, for fear I would shriek, I tried to think of something else—what time Gertrude would reach Halsey—anything but the grisly reality that lay just beyond me on the grass.  And then I heard a low exclamation from the detective and I felt the pressure of the doctor’s fingers on my arm.  “Now, Miss Innes,” he said gently. “If you will come over—”  I held on to him frantically, and somehow I got there and looked down. The lid of the casket had been raised and a silver plate on it proved we had made no mistake. But the face that showed in the light of the lantern was a face I had never seen before. The man who lay before us was not Paul Armstrong!     CHAPTER XXXI. BETWEEN TWO FIREPLACES   What with the excitement of the discovery, the walk home under the stars in wet shoes and draggled skirts, and getting up-stairs and undressed without rousing Liddy, I was completely used up. What to do with my boots was the greatest puzzle of all, there being no place in the house safe from Liddy, until I decided to slip upstairs the next morning and drop them into the hole the “ghost” had made in the trunk-room wall.  I went asleep as soon as I reached this decision, and in my dreams I lived over again the events of the night. Again I saw the group around the silent figure on the grass, and again, as had happened at the grave, I heard Alex’s voice, tense and triumphant:  “Then we’ve got them,” he said. Only, in my dreams, he said it over and over until he seemed to shriek it in my ears.  I wakened early, in spite of my fatigue, and lay there thinking. Who was Alex? I no longer believed that he was a gardener. Who was the man whose body we had resurrected? And where was Paul Armstrong? Probably living safely in some extraditionless country on the fortune he had stolen. Did Louise and her mother know of the shameful and wicked deception? What had Thomas known, and Mrs. Watson? Who was Nina Carrington?  This last question, it seemed to me, was answered. In some way the woman had learned of the substitution, and had tried to use her knowledge for blackmail. Nina Carrington’s own story died with her, but, however it happened, it was clear that she had carried her knowledge to Halsey the afternoon Gertrude and I were looking for clues to the man I had shot on the east veranda. Halsey had been half crazed by what he heard; it was evident that Louise was marrying Doctor Walker to keep the shameful secret, for her mother’s sake. Halsey, always reckless, had gone at once to Doctor Walker and denounced him. There had been a scene, and he left on his way to the station to meet and notify Mr. Jamieson of what he had learned. The doctor was active mentally and physically. Accompanied perhaps by Riggs, who had shown himself not overscrupulous until he quarreled with his employer, he had gone across to the railroad embankment, and, by jumping in front of the car, had caused Halsey to swerve. The rest of the story we knew.  That was my reconstructed theory of that afternoon and evening: it was almost correct—not quite.  There was a telegram that morning from Gertrude.  “Halsey conscious and improving. Probably home in day or so. GERTRUDE.”   With Halsey found and improving in health, and with at last something to work on, I began that day, Thursday, with fresh courage. As Mr. Jamieson had said, the lines were closing up. That I was to be caught and almost finished in the closing was happily unknown to us all.  It was late when I got up. I lay in my bed, looking around the four walls of the room, and trying to imagine behind what one of them a secret chamber might lie. Certainly, in daylight, Sunnyside deserved its name: never was a house more cheery and open, less sinister in general appearance. There was not a corner apparently that was not open and above-board, and yet, somewhere behind its handsomely papered walls I believed firmly that there lay a hidden room, with all the possibilities it would involve.  I made a mental note to have the house measured during the day, to discover any discrepancy between the outer and inner walls, and I tried to recall again the exact wording of the paper Jamieson had found.  The slip had said “chimney.” It was the only clue, and a house as large as Sunnyside was full of them. There was an open fireplace in my dressing-room, but none in the bedroom, and as I lay there, looking around, I thought of something that made me sit up suddenly. The trunk-room, just over my head, had an open fireplace and a brick chimney, and yet, there was nothing of the kind in my room. I got out of bed and examined the opposite wall closely. There was apparently no flue, and I knew there was none in the hall just beneath. The house was heated by steam, as I have said before. In the living-room was a huge open fireplace, but it was on the other side.  Why did the trunk-room have both a radiator and an open fireplace? Architects were not usually erratic! It was not fifteen minutes before I was up-stairs, armed with a tape-measure in lieu of a foot-rule, eager to justify Mr. Jamieson’s opinion of my intelligence, and firmly resolved not to tell him of my suspicion until I had more than theory to go on. The hole in the trunk-room wall still yawned there, between the chimney and the outer wall. I examined it again, with no new result. The space between the brick wall and the plaster and lath one, however, had a new significance. The hole showed only one side of the chimney, and I determined to investigate what lay in the space on the other side of the mantel.  I worked feverishly. Liddy had gone to the village to market, it being her firm belief that the store people sent short measure unless she watched the scales, and that, since the failure of the Traders’ Bank, we must watch the corners; and I knew that what I wanted to do must be done before she came back. I had no tools, but after rummaging around I found a pair of garden scissors and a hatchet, and thus armed, I set to work. The plaster came out easily: the lathing was more obstinate. It gave under the blows, only to spring back into place again, and the necessity for caution made it doubly hard.  I had a blister on my palm when at last the hatchet went through and fell with what sounded like the report of a gun to my overstrained nerves. I sat on a trunk, waiting to hear Liddy fly up the stairs, with the household behind her, like the tail of a comet. But nothing happened, and with a growing feeling of uncanniness I set to work enlarging the opening.  The result was absolutely _nil_. When I could hold a lighted candle in the opening, I saw precisely what I had seen on the other side of the chimney—a space between the true wall and the false one, possibly seven feet long and about three feet wide. It was in no sense of the word a secret chamber, and it was evident it had not been disturbed since the house was built. It was a supreme disappointment.  It had been Mr. Jamieson’s idea that the hidden room, if there was one, would be found somewhere near the circular staircase. In fact, I knew that he had once investigated the entire length of the clothes chute, hanging to a rope, with this in view. I was reluctantly about to concede that he had been right, when my eyes fell on the mantel and fireplace. The latter had evidently never been used: it was closed with a metal fire front, and only when the front refused to move, and investigation showed that it was not intended to be moved, did my spirits revive.  I hurried into the next room. Yes, sure enough, there was a similar mantel and fireplace there, similarly closed. In both rooms the chimney flue extended well out from the wall. I measured with the tape-line, my hands trembling so that I could scarcely hold it. They extended two feet and a half into each room, which, with the three feet of space between the two partitions, made eight feet to be accounted for. Eight feet in one direction and almost seven in the other—what a chimney it was!  But I had only located the hidden room. I was not in it, and no amount of pressing on the carving of the wooden mantels, no search of the floors for loose boards, none of the customary methods availed at all. That there was a means of entrance, and probably a simple one, I could be certain. But what? What would I find if I did get in? Was the detective right, and were the bonds and money from the Traders’ Bank there? Or was our whole theory wrong? Would not Paul Armstrong have taken his booty with him? If he had not, and if Doctor Walker was in the secret, he would have known how to enter the chimney room. Then—who had dug the other hole in the false partition?     CHAPTER XXXII. ANNE WATSON’S STORY   Liddy discovered the fresh break in the trunk-room wall while we were at luncheon, and ran shrieking down the stairs. She maintained that, as she entered, unseen hands had been digging at the plaster; that they had stopped when she went in, and she had felt a gust of cold damp air. In support of her story she carried in my wet and muddy boots, that I had unluckily forgotten to hide, and held them out to the detective and myself.  “What did I tell you?” she said dramatically. “Look at ’em. They’re yours, Miss Rachel—and covered with mud and soaked to the tops. I tell you, you can scoff all you like; something has been wearing your shoes. As sure as you sit there, there’s the smell of the graveyard on them. How do we know they weren’t tramping through the Casanova churchyard last night, and sitting on the graves!”  Mr. Jamieson almost choked to death. “I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they were doing that very thing, Liddy,” he said, when he got his breath. “They certainly look like it.”  I think the detective had a plan, on which he was working, and which was meant to be a coup. But things went so fast there was no time to carry it into effect. The first thing that occurred was a message from the Charity Hospital that Mrs. Watson was dying, and had asked for me. I did not care much about going. There is a sort of melancholy pleasure to be had out of a funeral, with its pomp and ceremony, but I shrank from a death-bed. However, Liddy got out the black things and the crape veil I keep for such occasions, and I went. I left Mr. Jamieson and the day detective going over every inch of the circular staircase, pounding, probing and measuring. I was inwardly elated to think of the surprise I was going to give them that night; as it turned out, I DID surprise them almost into spasms.  I drove from the train to the Charity Hospital, and was at once taken to a ward. There, in a gray-walled room in a high iron bed, lay Mrs. Watson. She was very weak, and she only opened her eyes and looked at me when I sat down beside her. I was conscience-stricken. We had been so engrossed that I had left this poor creature to die without even a word of sympathy.  The nurse gave her a stimulant, and in a little while she was able to talk. So broken and half-coherent, however, was her story that I shall tell it in my own way. In an hour from the time I entered the Charity Hospital, I had heard a sad and pitiful narrative, and had seen a woman slip into the unconsciousness that is only a step from death.  Briefly, then, the housekeeper’s story was this:  She was almost forty years old, and had been the sister-mother of a large family of children. One by one they had died, and been buried beside their parents in a little town in the Middle West. There was only one sister left, the baby, Lucy. On her the older girl had lavished all the love of an impulsive and emotional nature. When Anne, the elder, was thirty-two and Lucy was nineteen, a young man had come to the town. He was going east, after spending the summer at a celebrated ranch in Wyoming—one of those places where wealthy men send worthless and dissipated sons, for a season of temperance, fresh air and hunting. The sisters, of course, knew nothing of this, and the young man’s ardor rather carried them away. In a word, seven years before, Lucy Haswell had married a young man whose name was given as Aubrey Wallace.  Anne Haswell had married a carpenter in her native town, and was a widow. For three months everything went fairly well. Aubrey took his bride to Chicago, where they lived at a hotel. Perhaps the very unsophistication that had charmed him in Valley Mill jarred on him in the city. He had been far from a model husband, even for the three months, and when he disappeared Anne was almost thankful. It was different with the young wife, however. She drooped and fretted, and on the birth of her baby boy, she had died. Anne took the child, and named him Lucien.  Anne had had no children of her own, and on Lucien she had lavished all her aborted maternal instinct. On one thing she was determined, however: that was that Aubrey Wallace should educate his boy. It was a part of her devotion to the child that she should be ambitious for him: he must have every opportunity. And so she came east. She drifted around, doing plain sewing and keeping a home somewhere always for the boy. Finally, however, she realized that her only training had been domestic, and she put the boy in an Episcopalian home, and secured the position of housekeeper to the Armstrongs. There she found Lucien’s father, this time under his own name. It was Arnold Armstrong.  I gathered that there was no particular enmity at that time in Anne’s mind. She told him of the boy, and threatened exposure if he did not provide for him. Indeed, for a time, he did so. Then he realized that Lucien was the ruling passion in this lonely woman’s life. He found out where the child was hidden, and threatened to take him away. Anne was frantic. The positions became reversed. Where Arnold had given money for Lucien’s support, as the years went on he forced money from Anne Watson instead until she was always penniless. The lower Arnold sank in the scale, the heavier his demands became. With the rupture between him and his family, things were worse. Anne took the child from the home and hid him in a farmhouse near Casanova, on the Claysburg road. There she went sometimes to see the boy, and there he had taken fever. The people were Germans, and he called the farmer’s wife _Grossmutter_. He had grown into a beautiful boy, and he was all Anne had to live for.  The Armstrongs left for California, and Arnold’s persecutions began anew. He was furious over the child’s disappearance and she was afraid he would do her some hurt. She left the big house and went down to the lodge. When I had rented Sunnyside, however, she had thought the persecutions would stop. She had applied for the position of housekeeper, and secured it.  That had been on Saturday. That night Louise arrived unexpectedly. Thomas sent for Mrs. Watson and then went for Arnold Armstrong at the Greenwood Club. Anne had been fond of Louise—she reminded her of Lucy. She did not know what the trouble was, but Louise had been in a state of terrible excitement. Mrs. Watson tried to hide from Arnold, but he was ugly. He left the lodge and went up to the house about two-thirty, was admitted at the east entrance and came out again very soon. Something had occurred, she didn’t know what; but very soon Mr. Innes and another gentleman left, using the car.  Thomas and she had got Louise quiet, and a little before three, Mrs. Watson started up to the house. Thomas had a key to the east entry, and gave it to her.  On the way across the lawn she was confronted by Arnold, who for some reason was determined to get into the house. He had a golf-stick in his hand, that he had picked up somewhere, and on her refusal he had struck her with it. One hand had been badly cut, and it was that, poisoning having set in, which was killing her. She broke away in a frenzy of rage and fear, and got into the house while Gertrude and Jack Bailey were at the front door. She went up-stairs, hardly knowing what she was doing. Gertrude’s door was open, and Halsey’s revolver lay there on the bed. She picked it up and turning, ran part way down the circular staircase. She could hear Arnold fumbling at the lock outside. She slipped down quietly and opened the door: he was inside before she had got back to the stairs. It was quite dark, but she could see his white shirt-bosom. From the fourth step she fired. As he fell, somebody in the billiard-room screamed and ran. When the alarm was raised, she had had no time to get up-stairs: she hid in the west wing until every one was down on the lower floor. Then she slipped upstairs, and threw the revolver out of an upper window, going down again in time to admit the men from the Greenwood Club.  If Thomas had suspected, he had never told. When she found the hand Arnold had injured was growing worse, she gave the address of Lucien at Richfield to the old man, and almost a hundred dollars. The money was for Lucien’s board until she recovered. She had sent for me to ask me if I would try to interest the Armstrongs in the child. When she found herself growing worse, she had written to Mrs. Armstrong, telling her nothing but that Arnold’s legitimate child was at Richfield, and imploring her to recognize him. She was dying: the boy was an Armstrong, and entitled to his father’s share of the estate. The papers were in her trunk at Sunnyside, with letters from the dead man that would prove what she said. She was going; she would not be judged by earthly laws; and somewhere else perhaps Lucy would plead for her. It was she who had crept down the circular staircase, drawn by a magnet, that night Mr. Jamieson had heard some one there. Pursued, she had fled madly, anywhere—through the first door she came to. She had fallen down the clothes chute, and been saved by the basket beneath. I could have cried with relief; then it had not been Gertrude, after all!  That was the story. Sad and tragic though it was, the very telling of it seemed to relieve the dying woman. She did not know that Thomas was dead, and I did not tell her. I promised to look after little Lucien, and sat with her until the intervals of consciousness grew shorter and finally ceased altogether. She died that night.     CHAPTER XXXIII. AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS   As I drove rapidly up to the house from Casanova Station in the hack, I saw the detective Burns loitering across the street from the Walker place. So Jamieson was putting the screws on—lightly now, but ready to give them a twist or two, I felt certain, very soon.  The house was quiet. Two steps of the circular staircase had been pried off, without result, and beyond a second message from Gertrude, that Halsey insisted on coming home and they would arrive that night, there was nothing new. Mr. Jamieson, having failed to locate the secret room, had gone to the village. I learned afterwards that he called at Doctor Walker’s, under pretense of an attack of acute indigestion, and before he left, had inquired about the evening trains to the city. He said he had wasted a lot of time on the case, and a good bit of the mystery was in my imagination! The doctor was under the impression that the house was guarded day and night. Well, give a place a reputation like that, and you don’t need a guard at all,—thus Jamieson. And sure enough, late in the afternoon, the two private detectives, accompanied by Mr. Jamieson, walked down the main street of Casanova and took a city-bound train.  That they got off at the next station and walked back again to Sunnyside at dusk, was not known at the time. Personally, I knew nothing of either move; I had other things to absorb me at that time.  Liddy brought me some tea while I rested after my trip, and on the tray was a small book from the Casanova library. It was called _The Unseen World_ and had a cheerful cover on which a half-dozen sheeted figures linked hands around a headstone.  At this point in my story, Halsey always says: “Trust a woman to add two and two together, and make six.” To which I retort that if two and two plus X make six, then to discover the unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world. That a houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two make four.  The depression due to my visit to the hospital left me at the prospect of seeing Halsey again that night. It was about five o’clock when Liddy left me for a nap before dinner, having put me into a gray silk dressing-gown and a pair of slippers. I listened to her retreating footsteps, and as soon as she was safely below stairs, I went up to the trunk-room. The place had not been disturbed, and I proceeded at once to try to discover the entrance to the hidden room. The openings on either side, as I have said, showed nothing but perhaps three feet of brick wall.  There was no sign of an entrance—no levers, no hinges, to give a hint. Either the mantel or the roof, I decided, and after a half-hour at the mantel, productive of absolutely no result, I decided to try the roof.  I am not fond of a height. The few occasions on which I have climbed a step-ladder have always left me dizzy and weak in the knees. The top of the Washington monument is as impossible to me as the elevation of the presidential chair. And yet—I climbed out on to the Sunnyside roof without a second’s hesitation. Like a dog on a scent, like my bearskin progenitor, with his spear and his wild boar, to me now there was the lust of the chase, the frenzy of pursuit, the dust of battle. I got quite a little of the latter on me as I climbed from the unfinished ball-room out through a window to the roof of the east wing of the building, which was only two stories in height.  Once out there, access to the top of the main building was rendered easy—at least it looked easy—by a small vertical iron ladder, fastened to the wall outside of the ball-room, and perhaps twelve feet high. The twelve feet looked short from below, but they were difficult to climb. I gathered my silk gown around me, and succeeded finally in making the top of the ladder.  Once there, however, I was completely out of breath. I sat down, my feet on the top rung, and put my hair pins in more securely, while the wind bellowed my dressing-gown out like a sail. I had torn a great strip of the silk loose, and now I ruthlessly finished the destruction of my gown by jerking it free and tying it around my head.  From far below the smallest sounds came up with peculiar distinctness. I could hear the paper boy whistling down the drive, and I heard something else. I heard the thud of a stone, and a spit, followed by a long and startled _meiou_ from Beulah. I forgot my fear of a height, and advanced boldly almost to the edge of the roof.  It was half-past six by that time, and growing dusk.  “You boy, down there!” I called.  The paper boy turned and looked around. Then, seeing nobody, he raised his eyes. It was a moment before he located me: when he did, he stood for one moment as if paralyzed, then he gave a horrible yell, and dropping his papers, bolted across the lawn to the road without stopping to look around. Once he fell, and his impetus was so great that he turned an involuntary somersault. He was up and off again without any perceptible pause, and he leaped the hedge—which I am sure under ordinary stress would have been a feat for a man.  I am glad in this way to settle the Gray Lady story, which is still a choice morsel in Casanova. I believe the moral deduced by the village was that it is always unlucky to throw a stone at a black cat.  With Johnny Sweeny a cloud of dust down the road, and the dinner-hour approaching, I hurried on with my investigations. Luckily, the roof was flat, and I was able to go over every inch of it. But the result was disappointing; no trap-door revealed itself, no glass window; nothing but a couple of pipes two inches across, and standing perhaps eighteen inches high and three feet apart, with a cap to prevent rain from entering and raised to permit the passage of air. I picked up a pebble from the roof and dropped it down, listening with my ear at one of the pipes. I could hear it strike on something with a sharp, metallic sound, but it was impossible for me to tell how far it had gone.  I gave up finally and went down the ladder again, getting in through the ball-room window without being observed. I went back at once to the trunk-room, and, sitting down on a box, I gave my mind, as consistently as I could, to the problem before me. If the pipes in the roof were ventilators to the secret room, and there was no trap-door above, the entrance was probably in one of the two rooms between which it lay—unless, indeed, the room had been built, and the opening then closed with a brick and mortar wall.  The mantel fascinated me. Made of wood and carved, the more I looked the more I wondered that I had not noticed before the absurdity of such a mantel in such a place. It was covered with scrolls and panels, and finally, by the merest accident, I pushed one of the panels to the side. It moved easily, revealing a small brass knob.  It is not necessary to detail the fluctuations of hope and despair, and not a little fear of what lay beyond, with which I twisted and turned the knob. It moved, but nothing seemed to happen, and then I discovered the trouble. I pushed the knob vigorously to one side, and the whole mantel swung loose from the wall almost a foot, revealing a cavernous space beyond.  I took a long breath, closed the door from the trunk-room into the hall—thank Heaven, I did not lock it—and pulling the mantel-door wide open, I stepped into the chimney-room. I had time to get a hazy view of a small portable safe, a common wooden table and a chair—then the mantel door swung to, and clicked behind me. I stood quite still for a moment, in the darkness, unable to comprehend what had happened. Then I turned and beat furiously at the door with my fists. It was closed and locked again, and my fingers in the darkness slid over a smooth wooden surface without a sign of a knob.  I was furiously angry—at myself, at the mantel door, at everything. I did not fear suffocation; before the thought had come to me I had already seen a gleam of light from the two small ventilating pipes in the roof. They supplied air, but nothing else. The room itself was shrouded in blackness.  I sat down in the stiff-backed chair and tried to remember how many days one could live without food and water. When that grew monotonous and rather painful, I got up and, according to the time-honored rule for people shut in unknown and ink-black prisons, I felt my way around—it was small enough, goodness knows. I felt nothing but a splintery surface of boards, and in endeavoring to get back to the chair, something struck me full in the face, and fell with the noise of a thousand explosions to the ground. When I had gathered up my nerves again, I found it had been the bulb of a swinging electric light, and that had it not been for the accident, I might have starved to death in an illuminated sepulcher.  I must have dozed off. I am sure I did not faint. I was never more composed in my life. I remember planning, if I were not discovered, who would have my things. I knew Liddy would want my heliotrope poplin, and she’s a fright in lavender. Once or twice I heard mice in the partitions, and so I sat on the table, with my feet on the chair. I imagined I could hear the search going on through the house, and once some one came into the trunk-room; I could distinctly hear footsteps.  “In the chimney! In the chimney!” I called with all my might, and was rewarded by a piercing shriek from Liddy and the slam of the trunk-room door.  I felt easier after that, although the room was oppressively hot and enervating. I had no doubt the search for me would now come in the right direction, and after a little, I dropped into a doze. How long I slept I do not know.  It must have been several hours, for I had been tired from a busy day, and I wakened stiff from my awkward position. I could not remember where I was for a few minutes, and my head felt heavy and congested. Gradually I roused to my surroundings, and to the fact that in spite of the ventilators, the air was bad and growing worse. I was breathing long, gasping respirations, and my face was damp and clammy. I must have been there a long time, and the searchers were probably hunting outside the house, dredging the creek, or beating the woodland. I knew that another hour or two would find me unconscious, and with my inability to cry out would go my only chance of rescue. It was the combination of bad air and heat, probably, for some inadequate ventilation was coming through the pipes. I tried to retain my consciousness by walking the length of the room and back, over and over, but I had not the strength to keep it up, so I sat down on the table again, my back against the wall.  The house was very still. Once my straining ears seemed to catch a footfall beneath me, possibly in my own room. I groped for the chair from the table, and pounded with it frantically on the floor. But nothing happened: I realized bitterly that if the sound was heard at all, no doubt it was classed with the other rappings that had so alarmed us recently.  It was impossible to judge the flight of time. I measured five minutes by counting my pulse, allowing seventy-two beats to the minute. But it took eternities, and toward the last I found it hard to count; my head was confused.  And then—I heard sounds from below me, in the house. There was a peculiar throbbing, vibrating noise that I felt rather than heard, much like the pulsing beat of fire engines in the city. For one awful moment I thought the house was on fire, and every drop of blood in my body gathered around my heart; then I knew. It was the engine of the automobile, and Halsey had come back. Hope sprang up afresh. Halsey’s clear head and Gertrude’s intuition might do what Liddy’s hysteria and three detectives had failed in.  After a time I thought I had been right. There was certainly something going on down below; doors were slamming, people were hurrying through the halls, and certain high notes of excited voices penetrated to me shrilly. I hoped they were coming closer, but after a time the sounds died away below, and I was left to the silence and heat, to the weight of the darkness, to the oppression of walls that seemed to close in on me and stifle me.  The first warning I had was a stealthy fumbling at the lock of the mantel-door. With my mouth open to scream, I stopped. Perhaps the situation had rendered me acute, perhaps it was instinctive. Whatever it was, I sat without moving, and some one outside, in absolute stillness, ran his fingers over the carving of the mantel and—found the panel.  Now the sounds below redoubled: from the clatter and jarring I knew that several people were running up the stairs, and as the sounds approached, I could even hear what they said.  “Watch the end staircases!” Jamieson was shouting. “Damnation—there’s no light here!” And then a second later. “All together now. One—two—three—”  The door into the trunk-room had been locked from the inside. At the second that it gave, opening against the wall with a crash and evidently tumbling somebody into the room, the stealthy fingers beyond the mantel-door gave the knob the proper impetus, and—the door swung open, and closed again. Only—and Liddy always screams and puts her fingers in her ears at this point—only now I was not alone in the chimney room. There was some one else in the darkness, some one who breathed hard, and who was so close I could have touched him with my hand.  I was in a paralysis of terror. Outside there were excited voices and incredulous oaths. The trunks were being jerked around in a frantic search, the windows were thrown open, only to show a sheer drop of forty feet. And the man in the room with me leaned against the mantel-door and listened. His pursuers were plainly baffled: I heard him draw a long breath, and turn to grope his way through the blackness. Then—he touched my hand, cold, clammy, death-like.  A hand in an empty room! He drew in his breath, the sharp intaking of horror that fills lungs suddenly collapsed. Beyond jerking his hand away instantly, he made no movement. I think absolute terror had him by the throat. Then he stepped back, without turning, retreating foot by foot from The Dread in the corner, and I do not think he breathed.  Then, with the relief of space between us, I screamed, ear-splittingly, madly, and they heard me outside.  “In the chimney!” I shrieked. “Behind the mantel! The mantel!”  With an oath the figure hurled itself across the room at me, and I screamed again. In his blind fury he had missed me; I heard him strike the wall. That one time I eluded him; I was across the room, and I had got the chair. He stood for a second, listening, then—he made another rush, and I struck out with my weapon. I think it stunned him, for I had a second’s respite when I could hear him breathing, and some one shouted outside:  “We—Can’t—get—in. How—does—it—open?”  But the man in the room had changed his tactics. I knew he was creeping on me, inch by inch, and I could not tell from where. And then—he caught me. He held his hand over my mouth, and I bit him. I was helpless, strangling,—and some one was trying to break in the mantel from outside. It began to yield somewhere, for a thin wedge of yellowish light was reflected on the opposite wall. When he saw that, my assailant dropped me with a curse; then—the opposite wall swung open noiselessly, closed again without a sound, and I was alone. The intruder was gone.  “In the next room!” I called wildly. “The next room!” But the sound of blows on the mantel drowned my voice. By the time I had made them understand, a couple of minutes had elapsed. The pursuit was taken up then, by all except Alex, who was determined to liberate me. When I stepped out into the trunk-room, a free woman again, I could hear the chase far below.  I must say, for all Alex’s anxiety to set me free, he paid little enough attention to my plight. He jumped through the opening into the secret room, and picked up the portable safe.  “I am going to put this in Mr. Halsey’s room, Miss Innes,” he said, “and I shall send one of the detectives to guard it.”  I hardly heard him. I wanted to laugh and cry in the same breath—to crawl into bed and have a cup of tea, and scold Liddy, and do any of the thousand natural things that I had never expected to do again. And the air! The touch of the cool night air on my face!  As Alex and I reached the second floor, Mr. Jamieson met us. He was grave and quiet, and he nodded comprehendingly when he saw the safe.  “Will you come with me for a moment, Miss Innes?” he asked soberly, and on my assenting, he led the way to the east wing. There were lights moving around below, and some of the maids were standing gaping down. They screamed when they saw me, and drew back to let me pass. There was a sort of hush over the scene; Alex, behind me, muttered something I could not hear, and brushed past me without ceremony. Then I realized that a man was lying doubled up at the foot of the staircase, and that Alex was stooping over him.  As I came slowly down, Winters stepped back, and Alex straightened himself, looking at me across the body with impenetrable eyes. In his hand he held a shaggy gray wig, and before me on the floor lay the man whose headstone stood in Casanova churchyard—Paul Armstrong.  Winters told the story in a dozen words. In his headlong flight down the circular staircase, with Winters just behind, Paul Armstrong had pitched forward violently, struck his head against the door to the east veranda, and probably broken his neck. He had died as Winters reached him.  As the detective finished, I saw Halsey, pale and shaken, in the card-room doorway, and for the first time that night I lost my self-control. I put my arms around my boy, and for a moment he had to support me. A second later, over Halsey’s shoulder, I saw something that turned my emotion into other channels, for, behind him, in the shadowy card-room, were Gertrude and Alex, the gardener, and—there is no use mincing matters—he was kissing her!  I was unable to speak. Twice I opened my mouth: then I turned Halsey around and pointed. They were quite unconscious of us; her head was on his shoulder, his face against her hair. As it happened, it was Mr. Jamieson who broke up the tableau.  He stepped over to Alex and touched him on the arm.  “And now,” he said quietly, “how long are you and I to play OUR little comedy, Mr. Bailey?”     CHAPTER XXXIV. THE ODDS AND ENDS   Of Doctor Walker’s sensational escape that night to South America, of the recovery of over a million dollars in cash and securities in the safe from the chimney room—the papers have kept the public well informed. Of my share in discovering the secret chamber they have been singularly silent. The inner history has never been told. Mr. Jamieson got all kinds of credit, and some of it he deserved, but if Jack Bailey, as Alex, had not traced Halsey and insisted on the disinterring of Paul Armstrong’s casket, if he had not suspected the truth from the start, where would the detective have been?  When Halsey learned the truth, he insisted on going the next morning, weak as he was, to Louise, and by night she was at Sunnyside, under Gertrude’s particular care, while her mother had gone to Barbara Fitzhugh’s.  What Halsey said to Mrs. Armstrong I never knew, but that he was considerate and chivalrous I feel confident. It was Halsey’s way always with women.  He and Louise had no conversation together until that night. Gertrude and Alex—I mean Jack—had gone for a walk, although it was nine o’clock, and anybody but a pair of young geese would have known that dew was falling, and that it is next to impossible to get rid of a summer cold.  At half after nine, growing weary of my own company, I went downstairs to find the young people. At the door of the living-room I paused. Gertrude and Jack had returned and were there, sitting together on a divan, with only one lamp lighted. They did not see or hear me, and I beat a hasty retreat to the library. But here again I was driven back. Louise was sitting in a deep chair, looking the happiest I had ever seen her, with Halsey on the arm of the chair, holding her close.  It was no place for an elderly spinster. I retired to my upstairs sitting-room and got out Eliza Klinefelter’s lavender slippers. Ah, well, the foster motherhood would soon have to be put away in camphor again.  The next day, by degrees, I got the whole story.  Paul Armstrong had a besetting evil—the love of money. Common enough, but he loved money, not for what it would buy, but for its own sake. An examination of the books showed no irregularities in the past year since John had been cashier, but before that, in the time of Anderson, the old cashier, who had died, much strange juggling had been done with the records. The railroad in New Mexico had apparently drained the banker’s private fortune, and he determined to retrieve it by one stroke. This was nothing less than the looting of the bank’s securities, turning them into money, and making his escape.  But the law has long arms. Paul Armstrong evidently studied the situation carefully. Just as the only good Indian is a dead Indian, so the only safe defaulter is a dead defaulter. He decided to die, to all appearances, and when the hue and cry subsided, he would be able to enjoy his money almost anywhere he wished.  The first necessity was an accomplice. The connivance of Doctor Walker was suggested by his love for Louise. The man was unscrupulous, and with the girl as a bait, Paul Armstrong soon had him fast. The plan was apparently the acme of simplicity: a small town in the west, an attack of heart disease, a body from a medical college dissecting-room shipped in a trunk to Doctor Walker by a colleague in San Francisco, and palmed off for the supposed dead banker. What was simpler?  The woman, Nina Carrington, was the cog that slipped. What she only suspected, what she really knew, we never learned. She was a chambermaid in the hotel at C—, and it was evidently her intention to blackmail Doctor Walker. His position at that time was uncomfortable: to pay the woman to keep quiet would be confession. He denied the whole thing, and she went to Halsey.  It was this that had taken Halsey to the doctor the night he disappeared. He accused the doctor of the deception, and, crossing the lawn, had said something cruel to Louise. Then, furious at her apparent connivance, he had started for the station. Doctor Walker and Paul Armstrong—the latter still lame where I had shot him—hurried across to the embankment, certain only of one thing. Halsey must not tell the detective what he suspected until the money had been removed from the chimney-room. They stepped into the road in front of the car to stop it, and fate played into their hands. The car struck the train, and they had only to dispose of the unconscious figure in the road. This they did as I have told. For three days Halsey lay in the box car, tied hand and foot, suffering tortures of thirst, delirious at times, and discovered by a tramp at Johnsville only in time to save his life.  To go back to Paul Armstrong. At the last moment his plans had been frustrated. Sunnyside, with its hoard in the chimney-room, had been rented without his knowledge! Attempts to dislodge me having failed, he was driven to breaking into his own house. The ladder in the chute, the burning of the stable and the entrance through the card-room window—all were in the course of a desperate attempt to get into the chimney-room.  Louise and her mother had, from the first, been the great stumbling-blocks. The plan had been to send Louise away until it was too late for her to interfere, but she came back to the hotel at C— just at the wrong time. There was a terrible scene. The girl was told that something of the kind was necessary, that the bank was about to close and her stepfather would either avoid arrest and disgrace in this way, or kill himself. Fanny Armstrong was a weakling, but Louise was more difficult to manage. She had no love for her stepfather, but her devotion to her mother was entire, self-sacrificing. Forced into acquiescence by her mother’s appeals, overwhelmed by the situation, the girl consented and fled.  From somewhere in Colorado she sent an anonymous telegram to Jack Bailey at the Traders’ Bank. Trapped as she was, she did not want to see an innocent man arrested. The telegram, received on Thursday, had sent the cashier to the bank that night in a frenzy.  Louise arrived at Sunnyside and found the house rented. Not knowing what to do, she sent for Arnold at the Greenwood Club, and told him a little, not all. She told him that there was something wrong, and that the bank was about to close. That his father was responsible. Of the conspiracy she said nothing. To her surprise, Arnold already knew, through Bailey that night, that things were not right. Moreover, he suspected what Louise did not, that the money was hidden at Sunnyside. He had a scrap of paper that indicated a concealed room somewhere.  His inherited cupidity was aroused. Eager to get Halsey and Jack Bailey out of the house, he went up to the east entry, and in the billiard-room gave the cashier what he had refused earlier in the evening—the address of Paul Armstrong in California and a telegram which had been forwarded to the club for Bailey, from Doctor Walker. It was in response to one Bailey had sent, and it said that Paul Armstrong was very ill.  Bailey was almost desperate. He decided to go west and find Paul Armstrong, and to force him to disgorge. But the catastrophe at the bank occurred sooner than he had expected. On the moment of starting west, at Andrews Station, where Mr. Jamieson had located the car, he read that the bank had closed, and, going back, surrendered himself.  John Bailey had known Paul Armstrong intimately. He did not believe that the money was gone; in fact, it was hardly possible in the interval since the securities had been taken. Where was it? And from some chance remark let fall some months earlier by Arnold Armstrong at a dinner, Bailey felt sure there was a hidden room at Sunnyside. He tried to see the architect of the building, but, like the contractor, if he knew of the such a room he refused any information. It was Halsey’s idea that John Bailey come to the house as a gardener, and pursue his investigations as he could. His smooth upper lip had been sufficient disguise, with his change of clothes, and a hair-cut by a country barber.  So it was Alex, Jack Bailey, who had been our ghost. Not only had he alarmed—Louise and himself, he admitted—on the circular staircase, but he had dug the hole in the trunk-room wall, and later sent Eliza into hysteria. The note Liddy had found in Gertrude’s scrap-basket was from him, and it was he who had startled me into unconsciousness by the clothes chute, and, with Gertrude’s help, had carried me to Louise’s room. Gertrude, I learned, had watched all night beside me, in an extremity of anxiety about me.  That old Thomas had seen his master, and thought he had seen the Sunnyside ghost, there could be no doubt. Of that story of Thomas’, about seeing Jack Bailey in the footpath between the club and Sunnyside, the night Liddy and I heard the noise on the circular staircase—that, too, was right. On the night before Arnold Armstrong was murdered, Jack Bailey had made his first attempt to search for the secret room. He secured Arnold’s keys from his room at the club and got into the house, armed with a golf-stick for sounding the walls. He ran against the hamper at the head of the stairs, caught his cuff-link in it, and dropped the golf-stick with a crash. He was glad enough to get away without an alarm being raised, and he took the “owl” train to town.  The oddest thing to me was that Mr. Jamieson had known for some time that Alex was Jack Bailey. But the face of the pseudo-gardener was very queer indeed, when that night, in the card-room, the detective turned to him and said:  “How long are you and I going to play our little comedy, _Mr. Bailey?_”  Well, it is all over now. Paul Armstrong rests in Casanova churchyard, and this time there is no mistake. I went to the funeral, because I wanted to be sure he was really buried, and I looked at the step of the shaft where I had sat that night, and wondered if it was all real. Sunnyside is for sale—no, I shall not buy it. Little Lucien Armstrong is living with his step-grandmother, and she is recovering gradually from troubles that had extended over the entire period of her second marriage. Anne Watson lies not far from the man she killed, and who as surely caused her death. Thomas, the fourth victim of the conspiracy, is buried on the hill. With Nina Carrington, five lives were sacrificed in the course of this grim conspiracy.  There will be two weddings before long, and Liddy has asked for my heliotrope poplin to wear to the church. I knew she would. She has wanted it for three years, and she was quite ugly the time I spilled coffee on it. We are very quiet, just the two of us. Liddy still clings to her ghost theory, and points to my wet and muddy boots in the trunk-room as proof. I am gray, I admit, but I haven’t felt as well in a dozen years. Sometimes, when I am bored, I ring for Liddy, and we talk things over. When Warner married Rosie, Liddy sniffed and said what I took for faithfulness in Rosie had been nothing but mawkishness. I have not yet outlived Liddy’s contempt because I gave them silver knives and forks as a wedding gift.  So we sit and talk, and sometimes Liddy threatens to leave, and often I discharge her, but we stay together somehow. I am talking of renting a house next year, and Liddy says to be sure there is no ghost. To be perfectly frank, I never really lived until that summer. Time has passed since I began this story. My neighbors are packing up for another summer. Liddy is having the awnings put up, and the window boxes filled. Liddy or no Liddy, I shall advertise to-morrow for a house in the country, and I don’t care if it has a Circular Staircase.",

        "content": "  POIROT INVESTIGATES        I     The Adventure of “The Western Star”  I was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on the street below.  “That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath.  “What is, _mon ami_?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of his comfortable chair.  “Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady, richly dressed—fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming along slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl, gesticulating as he does so. What drama is this being played? Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her? Or are _they_ the scoundrels, and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?”  “The great detective, _mon ami_, chooses, as ever, the simplest course. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at the window.  In a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle.  “As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism. That is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, _en passant_, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!”  I laughed.  “So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.”  “_En vérité!_ And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, _mon cher_?”  I thought.  “About a dozen times perhaps.”  “And I—once! Yet _I_ recognize her, and _you_ do not.”  “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly.  “Ah! _Sacré_!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.”  I shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.  “But console yourself, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, calming down. “All cannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.”  “You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever knew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.  “What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share that opinion—even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.”  “What?”  “Without doubt. She is coming here.”  “How do you make that out?”  “Very simply. This street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_! In it there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist—still less is there a fashionable milliner! But there _is_ a fashionable detective. _Oui_, my friend, it is true—I am become the mode, the _dernier cri_! One says to another: ‘_Comment?_ You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too marvellous! Every one goes! _Courez!’_ And they arrive! In flocks, _mon ami_! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below. “What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.”  As usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American film star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.  Mary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their first visit to England. They had been given a great reception. Every one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful clothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great diamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the Western Star.” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds.  All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client.  Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking, with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.  Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once.  “You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice. I dare say it’s only a silly hoax—Gregory says so—but it’s just worrying me to death.”  She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement.  “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.”  “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot.  The latter scrutinized them closely.  “Cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure.  I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope. It ran as follows:  “The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came.”  The second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the third was more explicit:  “You have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will be taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is written.”  “The first letter I treated as a joke,” explained Miss Marvell. “When I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came yesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might be more serious than I had imagined.”  “I see they did not come by post, these letters.”  “No; they were left by hand—by a _Chinaman._ That is what frightens me.”  “Why?”  “Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought the stone three years ago.”  “I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be——”  “‘The Western Star,’” finished Miss Marvell. “That’s so. At the time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information. Gregory says he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing. He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was Greg’s wedding present to me.”  Poirot nodded thoughtfully.  “The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet—who knows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.”  I complied.  “_Voyons!_” said Poirot, turning the leaves.  “When is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in three days’ time. _Eh bien_, madame, you seek my advice—I give it to you. This _belle histoire_ may be a hoax—but it may not! Therefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.”  A slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied constrainedly:  “I’m afraid that’s impossible.”  “You have it with you—_hein_?” Poirot was watching her narrowly.  The girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward, unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely set in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.  Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.  “_Épatant!_” he murmured. “You permit, madame?” He took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her with a little bow. “A magnificent stone—without a flaw. Ah, _cent tonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme ça_!”  “No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it’s locked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit. We’re staying at the _Magnificent_, you know. I just brought it along to-day for you to see.”  “And you will leave it with me, _n’est-ce pas_? You will be advised by Papa Poirot?”  “Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot. On Friday we’re going down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly.”  Her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some gossip—what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends—but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California—why! it came to me in a flash—of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf.  “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing. “We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.”  “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.”  Miss Marvell nodded.  “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.”  “But—I demand pardon if I am dense, madame—surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?”  A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older.  “I want to wear it down there.”  “Surely” I said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in the Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?”  “That’s so,” said Miss Marvell briefly.  I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: “Ah, _c’est comme ça_!” Then he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “Then you are without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps your husband is?”  “Gregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,” said Miss Marvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “Do either of you ever see _Society Gossip_?”  We both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.  “I ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous jewels, and it’s really very curious——” She broke off.  I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found the article, and began to read aloud:  “. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the East, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China, and a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this, the stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond, exactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the story goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen. ‘One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once more. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ It is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one, and known as ‘the Star of the West,’ or ‘the Western Star.’ It is the property of the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of the two stones would be interesting.”  She stopped.  “_Épatant!_” murmured Poirot. “Without doubt a romance of the first water.” He turned to Mary Marvell. “And you are not afraid, madame? You have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce these two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear and, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?”  His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it.  “I don’t believe that Lady Yardly’s diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine,” said Miss Marvell. “Anyway, I’m going to see.”  What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment the door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the room. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his patent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.  “I said I’d call round for you, Mary,” said Gregory Rolf, “and here I am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem? Just one big hoax, same as I do?”  Poirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast.  “Hoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,” he said dryly, “I have advised Madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.”  “I’m with you there, sir. I’ve already said so to Mary. But there! She’s a woman through and through, and I guess she can’t bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.”  “What nonsense, Gregory!” said Mary Marvell sharply. But she flushed angrily.  Poirot shrugged his shoulders.  “Madame, I have advised. I can do no more. _C’est fini_.”  He bowed them both to the door.  “Ah! _la la_,” he observed, returning. “_Histoire de femmes!_ The good husband, he hit the nail on the head—_tout de même_, he was not tactful! Assuredly not.”  I imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously.  “So I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath all this. With your permission, _mon ami_, I will take the air. Await my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.”  I was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door, and put her head in.  “It’s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I’ve told her he was out, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from the country.”  “Oh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something for her.”  In another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a leap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly’s portrait had figured too often in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.  “Do sit down, Lady Yardly,” I said, drawing forward a chair. “My friend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he’ll be back very shortly.”  She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss Mary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud face—yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.  I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot’s presence I have frequently felt a difficulty—I do not appear at my best. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive sense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.  “Lady Yardly,” I said, “I know why you have come here. You have received blackmailing letters about the diamond.”  There was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at me open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.  “You know?” she gasped. “How?”  I smiled.  “By a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning letters——”  “Miss Marvell? She has been here?”  “She has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one of the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings, you, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done the same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have received these strange communications also?”  For a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me or not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.  “That is so,” she acknowledged.  “Were yours, too, left by hand—by a Chinaman?”  “No, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone the same experience, then?”  I recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened attentively.  “It all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true that they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating them—something in the nature of joss-stick—that at once suggested the East to me. What does it all mean?”  I shook my head.  “That is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We might learn something from the postmarks.”  “Unfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I regarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too incredible.”  We went over the facts again and again, but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose.  “I really don’t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell him all this, can’t you? Thank you so much, Mr.——”  She hesitated, her hand outstretched.  “Captain Hastings.”  “Of course! How stupid of me. You’re a friend of the Cavendishes, aren’t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.”  When my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and I could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent. I also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself, though I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In spite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint little friend.  “_Bien!_” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “The plot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that ‘Peerage’ on the top shelf there.” He turned the leaves. “Ah, here we are! ‘Yardly . . . 10th viscount, served South African War’ . . . _tout ça n’a pas d’importance_ . . . ‘mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth daughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril’ . . . um, um, um, . . . ‘has iss. two daughters, born 1908, 1910. . . . Clubs . . . residences.’ . . . _Voilà_, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see this _milord_!”  “What?”  “Yes. I telegraphed to him.”  “I thought you had washed your hands of the case?”  “I am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction—the satisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in this pie.”  “And you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience. He won’t be pleased.”  “_Au contraire_, if I preserve for him his family diamond, he ought to be very grateful.”  “Then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?” I asked eagerly.  “Almost a certainty,” replied Poirot placidly. “Everything points that way.”  “But how——”  Poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand.  “Not now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that ‘Peerage’—how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath, and so on. Thus we have order, _method_, which, as I have often told you, Hastings——”  “Exactly,” I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its proper place.     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   Lord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with a rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.  “Extraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can’t make head or tail of it. Seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and that this Miss Marvell’s had ’em too. What does it all mean?”  Poirot handed him the copy of _Society Gossip_.  “First, _milord_, I would ask you if these facts are substantially correct?”  The peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read.  “Damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “There’s never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I believe. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.”  “Still, the stone _is_ known as ‘The Star of the East.’”  “Well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully.  Poirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. “What I would ask you to do, _milord_, is to place yourself in my hands. If you do so unreservedly, I have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.”  “Then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat tales?”  “Will you do as I ask you?”  “Of course I will, but——”  “_Bien!_ Then permit that I ask you a few questions. This affair of Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and Mr. Rolf?”  “Oh, he told you about it, did he? No, there’s nothing settled.” He hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. “Might as well get the thing straight. I’ve made rather an ass of myself in many ways, Monsieur Poirot—and I’m head over ears in debt—but I want to pull up. I’m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten things up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf is offering me big money—enough to set me on my feet again. I don’t want to do it—I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting round the Chase—but I may have to, unless——” He broke off.  Poirot eyed him keenly. “You have, then, another string to your bow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the East?”  Lord Yardly nodded. “That’s it. It’s been in the family for some generations, but it’s not entailed. Still, it’s not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden man, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to find one soon, or it’s a washout.”  “One more question, _permettez_—Lady Yardly, which plan does she approve?”  “Oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. You know what women are. She’s all for this film stunt.”  “I comprehend,” said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought, then rose briskly to his feet. “You return to Yardly Chase at once? _Bien!_ Say no word to anyone—to _anyone_ mind—but expect us there this evening. We will arrive shortly after five.”  “All right, but I don’t see——”  “_Ça n’a pas d’importance_,” said Poirot kindly. “You will that I preserve for you your diamond, _n’est-ce pas_?”  “Yes, but——”  “Then do as I say.”  A sadly bewildered nobleman left the room.    •   •   •   •   •   •   •  It was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs. A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her two children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them.  “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,” announced the butler.  Lady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward uncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little man was equal to the occasion.  “All my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss Marvell’s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure. Also I wanted to ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received?”  Lady Yardly shook her head regretfully. “I’m afraid I don’t. It is stupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them seriously.”  “You’ll stay the night?” said Lord Yardly.  “Oh, _milord_, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at the inn.”  “That’s all right.” Lord Yardly had his cue. “We’ll send down for them. No, no—no trouble, I assure you.”  Poirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady Yardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time they were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.  “_Vous êtes bonne mère_,” said Poirot, with a gallant little bow, as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.  Lady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair.  “I adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice.  “And they you—with reason!” Poirot bowed again.  A dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. At that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word of apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly.  With an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at my friend.  “Just a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about this. It’s from Hoffberg. He thinks he’s found a customer for the diamond—an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They’re sending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if this goes through——” Words failed him.  Lady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her hand.  “I wish you wouldn’t sell it, George,” she said, in a low voice. “It’s been in the family so long.” She waited, as though for a reply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her shoulders. “I must go and dress. I suppose I had better display ‘the goods.’” She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. “It’s one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George has always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never been done.” She left the room.  Half an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room awaiting the lady. It was already a few minutes past the dinner hour.  Suddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed in the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress. Round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there with one hand just touching the necklace.  “Behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to have vanished. “Wait while I turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.”  The switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her hand to them, the incredible thing happened. Suddenly without any warning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from the other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream.  “My God!” cried Lord Yardly. “That was Maude’s voice! What has happened?”  We rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the darkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight met our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck.  As we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive, her eyelids opened.  “The Chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “The Chinaman—the side door.”  Lord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart beating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry. There, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace, evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I swooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord Yardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap. The Star of the East was missing!  “That settles it,” I breathed. “These were no ordinary thieves. This one stone was all they wanted.”  “But how did the fellow get in?”  “Through this door.”  “But it’s always locked.”  I shook my head. “It’s not locked now. See.” I pulled it open as I spoke.  As I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It was a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had been torn from a Chinaman’s robe.  “In his haste it caught in the door,” I explained. “Come, hurry. He cannot have gone far as yet.”  But in vain we hunted and searched. In the pitch darkness of the night, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned reluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste to fetch the police.  Lady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a woman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story.  “I was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a man sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with such force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him disappearing through the side door. Then I realized by the pig-tail and the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.” She stopped with a shudder.  The butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly.  “A gentleman from Mr. Hoffberg’s, m’lord. He says you expect him.”  “Good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “I must see him, I suppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.”  I drew Poirot aside.  “Look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to London?”  “You think so, Hastings? Why?”  “Well”—I coughed delicately—“things haven’t gone very well, have they? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be well—and then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose!”  “True,” said Poirot, rather crestfallen. “It was not one of my most striking triumphs.”  This way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I stuck to my guns.  “So, having—pardon the expression—rather made a mess of things, don’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?”  “And the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the _chef_ of Lord Yardly has prepared?”  “Oh, what’s dinner!” I said impatiently.  Poirot held up his hands in horror.  “_Mon Dieu!_ It is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference.”  “There’s another reason why we should get back to London as soon as possible,” I continued.  “What is that, my friend?”  “The other diamond,” I said, lowering my voice. “Miss Marvell’s.”  “_Eh bien_, what of it?”  “Don’t you see?” His unusual obtuseness annoyed me. What had happened to his usually keen wits? “They’ve got one, now they’ll go for the other.”  “_Tiens!_” cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration. “But your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.”  I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.  My idea was to go at once to the _Magnificent_, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly.  In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them. I gave way unwillingly.  Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief “_Bien, j’y serai_” he rang off, and turned to me.  “What do you think, _mon ami_?” He looked half ashamed, half excited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.”  “What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?”  “This morning, I understand.”  I shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me. You see I was right.”  “It appears so, _mon ami_,” said Poirot cautiously. “Appearances are deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.”  As we hurried in a taxi to the _Magnificent_, I puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme.  “That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.”  “_Ma foi!_” said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse. “One cannot think of everything!”  I felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind.  “Cheer up,” I said consolingly. “Better luck next time.”  At the _Magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager’s office. Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them.  Rolf nodded to us as we entered.  “We’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it’s almost unbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can’t think.”  A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself—it’s something about the eyes.”  “I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.”  “Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?”  The man looked up at him and started.  “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours.  The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.”  “What about the jewel-case?” I asked.  “It was found in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing had been taken—‘the Western Star.’”  We stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.  Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?”  “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf.  “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?”  “Certainly.”  In about five minutes Poirot reappeared.  “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.”  “Who to?”  “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine. “Come, come, _mon ami_. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _Bien!_ All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.”  It was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught.  “I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that——”  Poirot held up his hand.  “My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.”  “_You_—but why? What?” The nobleman spluttered impotently.  “My little idea was to bring things to a head,” explained Poirot placidly.  “Bring things to a head! Oh, my God!” cried Lord Yardly.  “And the ruse succeeded,” said Poirot cheerfully. “Therefore, _milord_, I have much pleasure in returning you—this!” With a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. It was a great diamond.  “The Star of the East,” gasped Lord Yardly. “But I don’t understand——”  “No?” said Poirot. “It makes no matter. Believe me, it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen. I promised you that it should be preserved to you, and I have kept my word. You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What _beau temps_, is it not? Good day, _milord_.”  And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands.  “Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?”  “No, _mon ami_, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.”  “How did you get the diamond.”  “From Mr. Rolf.”  “Rolf?”  “_Mais oui!_ The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in _Society Gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah! they did not exist. There was only _one_ diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-là_!  “But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled.  “For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.”  “Lady Yardly?”  “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance. But _au fond_, he is very business-like, _ce monsieur_! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of ‘the Western Star’ struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly prepares to range himself—to settle down. And then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be discovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory Rolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising to arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have £50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery—and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs——”  “But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected.  “I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!”  “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity.  “I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!”  I pondered the matter.  “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.”  “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. _Bonne mère, très femme!_”  “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.”  “_Pas du tout_,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_ told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.”  “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung.  “_Si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology. She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, _never_ does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!”  “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!”  “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.”  “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.”  “_Mon Dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!”  “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!       II     The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor   I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.  “_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.”  “You are called away on a case, then?”  “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.”  “Yes?” I said, much interested.  “There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last—the day before yesterday—the body of Mr. Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably. Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.”  About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.  “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked.  “First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.”  The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell.  We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.  Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind.  “Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?”  “You consider him a rich man, doctor?”  The doctor looked rather surprised.  “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.”  “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly.  The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly.  “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.”  “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?”  “My dear sir, I never attended him.”  “What?”  “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist—or something of that kind.”  “But you examined the body?”  “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.”  “And the cause of death was clear?”  “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.”  “Was he still lying where he had been found?”  “Yes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.”  “No question of his having been shot, eh?”  “My dear sir!”  “I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!”  “You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,” said Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing further——”  We took the hint.  “Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?”  “Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.”  And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.  “And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor.  “Rather an old ass.”  “Exactly. Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.”  I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:  “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!”  I looked at him coldly.  On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold.  “Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered.  “Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? _Les affaires_—they know no mercy.”  Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.  “It is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? But must I be bothered _now_—so soon?”  “Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the Company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have empowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you. Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?”  “I was changing for tea when my maid came up—one of the gardeners had just run to the house. He had found——”  Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.  “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?”  “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.”  “Shooting rooks, eh?”  “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.”  “Where is this little rook rifle now?”  “In the hall, I think.”  She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.  “Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see——”  He paused delicately.  “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head.  The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us.  “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know anything of your husband’s financial position?”  She shook her head.  “Nothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.”  “I see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.”  “Well, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to why he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition of his own death. I gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already, and that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was only too right!”  Tears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together.  “_Eh bien_, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears to be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet——”  “Yet what?”  “A slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not? Still, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own life—there is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood. No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and above-board—but who is this?”  A tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. He passed us without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking, with a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime. A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him.  “Tell me, I pray you, who is that gentleman? Do you know him?”  “I don’t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it. He was staying down here last week for a night. Tuesday, it was.”  “Quick, _mon ami_, let us follow him.”  We hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of a black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and our quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of the meeting.  Mrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face blanched noticeably.  “You,” she gasped. “I thought you were on the sea—on your way to East Africa?”  “I got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the young man. “My old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money. Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel my passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down to see if there was anything I could do. You’ll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps.”  At that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped forward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs. Maltravers made the necessary introduction.  “Monsieur Poirot, Captain Black.”  A few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited the fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn. The missing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising), Poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.  We returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee line for the Anchor Inn.  “Here we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,” he explained. “You notice that I emphasized the point that we were returning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I meant it. But no—you observed Mrs. Maltravers’ face when she caught sight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he—_eh bien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here on Tuesday night—the day before Mr. Maltravers died. We must investigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.”  In about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn. Poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged.  “I have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us here,” he explained. “You can understand, _monsieur le capitaine_, that I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers’ state of mind immediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not wish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can give us equally valuable information.”  “I’ll do anything I can to help you, I’m sure,” replied the young soldier; “but I’m afraid I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my people’s, I didn’t know him very well myself.”  “You came down—when?”  “Tuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as my boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o’clock. But some news I got made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to Mrs. Maltravers.”  “You were returning to East Africa, I understand?”  “Yes. I’ve been out there ever since the War—a great country.”  “Exactly. Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?”  “Oh, I don’t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my people, and then we discussed the question of German reparations, and then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East Africa, and I told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, I think.”  “Thank you.”  Poirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “With your permission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told us all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your subconscious self.”  “Psychoanalysis, what?” said Black, with visible alarm.  “Oh, no,” said Poirot reassuringly. “You see, it is like this, I give you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the first one you think of. Shall we begin?”  “All right,” said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy.  “Note down the words, please, Hastings,” said Poirot. Then he took from his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table beside him. “We will commence. Day.”  There was a moment’s pause, and then Black replied:  “_Night_.”  As Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.  “Name,” said Poirot.  “_Place_.”  “Bernard.”  “_Shaw_.”  “Tuesday.”  “_Dinner_.”  “Journey.”  “_Ship_.”  “Country.”  “_Uganda_.”  “Story.”  “_Lions_.”  “Rook Rifle.”  “_Farm_.”  “Shot.”  “_Suicide_.”  “Elephant.”  “_Tusks_.”  “Money.”  “_Lawyers_.”  “Thank you, Captain Black. Perhaps you could spare me a few minutes in about half an hour’s time?”  “Certainly.” The young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped his brow as he got up.  “And now, Hastings,” said Poirot, smiling at me as the door closed behind him. “You see it all, do you not?”  “I don’t know what you mean.”  “Does that list of words tell you nothing?”  I scrutinized it, but was forced to shake my head.  “I will assist you. To begin with, Black answered well within the normal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘Day’ to ‘Night’ and ‘Place’ to ‘Name’ are normal associations. I began work with ‘Bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all. Evidently he had not. After our recent conversation, he gave ‘Dinner’ to my ‘Tuesday,’ but ‘Journey’ and ‘Country’ were answered by ‘Ship’ and ‘Uganda,’ showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here. ‘Story’ recalls to him one of the ‘Lion’ stories he told at dinner. I proceed to ‘Rook Rifle’ and he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘Farm.’ When I say ‘Shot,’ he answers at once ‘Suicide.’ The association seems clear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere. Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far from the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on Tuesday evening.”  Black was straightforward enough over the matter.  “Yes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it. Chap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors were no end puzzled over it—there was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips. But what——”  “What has it got to do with Mr. Maltravers? You did not know, I see, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.”  “You mean my story suggested to him—oh, but that is awful!”  “Do not distress yourself—it would have been one way or another. Well, I must get on the telephone to London.”  Poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back thoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was not till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off no longer, but must break the news to the young widow. My sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless, and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I cherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He evidently admired her enormously.  Our interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to believe the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty. Poirot was very sorry for the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance Company, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said gently to Mrs. Maltravers:  “Madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!”  “What do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide.  “Have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? You are mediumistic, you know.”  “I have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism, surely?”  “Madame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say in the village that this house is haunted?”  She nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready.  “Won’t you just stay and have something to eat?”  We accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs.  We had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the door, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The parlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart.  “It was a man—standing in the passage.”  Poirot rushed out, returning quickly.  “There is no one there.”  “Isn’t there, sir?” said the parlourmaid weakly. “Oh, it did give me a start!”  “But why?”  She dropped her voice to a whisper.  “I thought—I thought it was the master—it looked like ’im.”  I saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it too, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirot’s arm with a scream.  “Didn’t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? That’s how _he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house.”  “The ivy,” I cried. “It was the ivy against the pane.”  But a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was obviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers besought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be left alone. We sat in the little morning-room. The wind was getting up, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp.  “Ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried  Poirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then turned the key in the lock. “I shall lock it, so!”  “Don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now——”  And even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door slowly swung open. I could not see into the passage from where I sat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek as she turned to him.  “You saw him—there in the passage?” she cried.  He was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his head.  “I saw him—my husband—you must have seen him too?”  “Madame, I saw nothing. You are not well—unstrung——”  “I am perfectly well, I——Oh, God!”  Suddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out. Out of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs. Maltravers moaning.  And then—I saw!  The man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us, gleaming with a faint ghostly light. There was blood on his lips, and he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and fell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and something else!  “My God, Poirot!” I cried. “Look at her hand, her right hand. It’s all red!”  Her own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor.  “Blood,” she cried hysterically. “Yes, it’s blood. I killed him. I did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger and pressed. Save me from him—save me! he’s come back!”  Her voice died away in a gurgle.  “Lights,” said Poirot briskly.  The lights went on as if by magic.  “That’s it,” he continued. “You heard, Hastings? And you, Everett? Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the theatrical profession. I ’phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up is good, isn’t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression. I shouldn’t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint marks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By the way, we mustn’t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the window. A bad night—but he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then.”  “You see,” continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind and rain, “there was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to think the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have given him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did not observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see nothing!”  “Well, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black’s story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr. Maltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally ingenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter view. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toe—or at least so I imagine. Now if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like that would have been remembered.  “No, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder, not suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played to-night.”  “Even now I don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” I said.  “Let us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming woman who, knowing of her husband’s financial _débâcle_ and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces him to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that—the young soldier’s strange story. The next afternoon when _monsieur le capitaine_, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her husband are strolling round the grounds. ‘What a curious story that was last night!’ she observes. ‘Could a man shoot himself in such a way? Do show me if it is possible!’ The poor fool—he shows her. He places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and puts her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. ‘And now, sir,’ she says saucily, ‘supposing I pull the trigger?’  “And then—and then, Hastings—she pulls it!”       III     The Adventure of the Cheap Flat   So far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot’s investigations have started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to chronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot’s attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case.  I had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald Parker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject of house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker’s special hobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and would forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd business head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then it was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose. Finally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little bride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before, as Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker’s.  “Talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck, Mr. Parker? We’ve got a flat—at last! In Montagu Mansions.”  “Well,” said Parker, “I’ve always said there are plenty of flats—at a price!”  “Yes, but this isn’t at a price. It’s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a year!”  “But—but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn’t it? Big handsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere?”  “No, it’s the Knightsbridge one. That’s what makes it so wonderful.”  “Wonderful is the word! It’s a blinking miracle. But there must be a catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?”  “No premium!”  “No prem—oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned Parker.  “But we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued Mrs. Robinson.  “Ah!” Parker brisked up. “I knew there was a catch!”  “For fifty pounds. And it’s beautifully furnished!”  “I give it up,” said Parker. “The present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy.”  Mrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker appeared between her dainty brows.  “It _is_ queer, isn’t it? You don’t think that—that—the place is _haunted_?”  “Never heard of a haunted flat,” declared Parker decisively.  “N-o.” Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. “But there were several things about it all that struck me as—well, queer.”  “For instance——” I suggested.  “Ah,” said Parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused! Unburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries.”  I laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle thrust upon me.  “Oh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the agents, Stosser and Paul—we hadn’t tried them before because they only have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate it would do no harm—everything they offered us was four and five hundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were going, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be taken—‘snapped up’ as the clerk put it—only people were so tiresome in not letting them know, and then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.”  Mrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then continued: “We thanked him, and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good, but that we should like an order all the same—just in case. And we went there straight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No. 4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for the lift, Elsie Ferguson—she’s a friend of mine, Captain Hastings, and they are looking for a flat too—came hurrying down the stairs. ‘Ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said. ‘But it’s no good. It’s already let.’ That seemed to finish it, but—well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we could afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a premium.——A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite ashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.”  I assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for house-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always applied.  “So we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at all. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the mistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the agreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” Mrs. Robinson paused triumphantly.  “And what about Mrs. Ferguson?” asked Parker. “Let’s have your deductions, Hastings.”  “‘Obvious, my dear Watson,’” I quoted lightly. “She went to the wrong flat.”  “Oh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!” cried Mrs. Robinson admiringly.  I rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities.     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   The whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as a mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed interested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities.  “A curious story,” he said thoughtfully. “Excuse me, Hastings, I must take a short stroll.”  When he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke.  “It is as well, _mon ami_, that we have no affairs of moment on hand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.”  “What investigation are you talking about?”  “The remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, Mrs. Robinson’s, new flat.”  “Poirot, you are not serious!”  “I am most serious. Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real rent of those flats is £350. I have just ascertained that from the landlord’s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds! Why?”  “There must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as Mrs. Robinson suggested.”  Poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.  “Then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!”  “But surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.”  “You may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it, and yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the market when Mrs. Robinson arrived.”  “That shows that there must be something wrong about it.”  “Mrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious, is it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?”  “She was a delightful creature!”  “_Évidemment!_ since she renders you incapable of replying to my question. Describe her to me, then.”  “Well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of auburn——”  “Always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!” murmured Poirot. “But continue.”  “Blue eyes and a very nice complexion and—well, that’s all, I think,” I concluded lamely.  “And her husband?”  “Oh, he’s quite a nice fellow—nothing startling.”  “Dark or fair?”  “I don’t know—betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of face.”  Poirot nodded.  “Yes, there are hundreds of these average men—and, anyway, you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women. Do you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them well.”  “They are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot, you don’t think for an instant——”  Poirot raised his hand.  “_Tout doucement, mon ami_. Have I said that I think anything? All I say is—it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light upon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, Hastings?”  “Her name is Stella,” I said stiffly, “but I don’t see——”  Poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed to be amusing him vastly.  “And Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!”  “What on earth——”  “And stars give light! _Voilà!_ Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not put on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu Mansions and make a few inquiries.”  I accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot addressed himself:  “Pardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside here?”  The porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out:  “No. 4. Second floor.”  “I thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?”  “Six months.”  I started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirot’s malicious grin.  “Impossible,” I cried. “You must be making a mistake.”  “Six months.”  “Are you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and——”  “That’s ’er,” said the porter. “Come in the Michaelmas quarter, they did. Just six months ago.”  He appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall. I followed Poirot outside.  “_Eh bien_, Hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “Are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth?”  I did not reply.  Poirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him what he was going to do and where we were going.  “To the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a flat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting things will take place there before long.”  We were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it for a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests:  “But I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By the way, Hastings, have you a revolver?”  “Yes—somewhere,” I answered, slightly thrilled. “Do you think——”  “That you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you, I see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.”  The following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat was pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the building as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher.  The day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon, Poirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below.  “Look over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them see you.”  I craned my neck over the staircase.  “That’s them,” I declared in an ungrammatical whisper.  “Good. Wait awhile.”  About half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back into the flat.  “_C’est ça_. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat should now be empty.”  “What are we going to do?” I asked uneasily.  Poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coal-lift.  “We are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he explained cheerfully. “No one will observe us. The Sunday concert, the Sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the Sunday nap after the Sunday dinner of England—_le rosbif_—all these will distract attention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.”  He stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him gingerly.  “Are we going to break into the flat?” I asked dubiously.  Poirot’s answer was not too reassuring:  “Not precisely to-day,” he replied.  Pulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second floor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open.  “You observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night yes—though not always then—and it is against that that we are going to make provision.”  He had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once set deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied about three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket, and we reascended once more to our own domain.     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   On Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.  “Hastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?”  “Go ahead,” I laughed. “I presume that it is a true story, not one of your efforts of fancy.”  “It is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for its accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some important Naval plans were stolen from an American Government department. They showed the position of some of the most important Harbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign Government—that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon a young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was employed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing at the same time as the papers. Whether Luigi Valdarno was the thief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New York, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past Luigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the antecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about the time of Valdarno’s death. There are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various _aliases_. The American Secret Service, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye upon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington. They felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question. One of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face of it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.” Poirot paused, and then added softly: “The official description of Elsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair complexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.”  “Mrs. Robinson!” I gasped.  “Well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended Poirot. “Also, I learn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring about the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, _mon ami_, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night, and join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below—armed with that excellent revolver of yours, _bien entendu_!”  “Rather,” I cried with enthusiasm. “When shall we start?”  “The hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing is likely to occur before then.”  At twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift and lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot’s manipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed into the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar.  “Now we have but to wait,” said Poirot contentedly, closing his eyes.  To me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to sleep. Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight hours—and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutes—a faint scratching sound came to my ears. Poirot’s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there. Poirot placed his lips to my ear.  “Outside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give the word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast. Be careful, he will have a knife.”  Presently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light appeared through the door. It was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves against the wall. I heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. Then he flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear:  “_Allez_.”  We sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his arms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless. I twisted a dagger from his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes, whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man nodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive followed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were out in the street, Poirot turned to me.  “There is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the revolver. We shall not need it now.”  “But if this fellow tries to escape?”  Poirot smiled.  “He will not.”  I returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. The scarf had been unwound from the stranger’s face, and I gave a start of surprise.  “He’s not a Jap,” I ejaculated in a whisper to Poirot.  “Observation was always your strong point, Hastings! Nothing escapes you. No, the man is not a Jap. He is an Italian.”  We got into the taxi, and Poirot gave the driver an address in St. John’s Wood. I was by now completely fogged. I did not like to ask Poirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings.  We alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something sharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the steps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously.  A light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was opened cautiously a little way.  “What the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly.  “I want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.”  “There’s no doctor here.”  The man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in adroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated Frenchman.  “What you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You must come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.”  “My dear sir——” The door was opened again, the man, clad in a dressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with an uneasy glance round.  “I will call the police.”  Poirot prepared to descend the steps.  “No, don’t do that for Heaven’s sake!” The man dashed after him.  With a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted.  “Quick—in here.” Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so. “And you—behind the curtain.”  “Si, signor,” said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window.  Not a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form.  “Where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance. “Who are you?”  Poirot stepped forward with a bow.  “It is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. I observed that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown was a warm one.”  “Who are you? What are you doing in my house?”  “It is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance, madame. It is especially to be regretted as one of our number has come specially from New York in order to meet you.”  The curtains parted and the Italian stepped out. To my horror I observed that he was brandishing my revolver, which Poirot must doubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab.  The woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but Poirot was standing in front of the closed door.  “Let me by,” she shrieked. “He will murder me.”  “Who was it dat croaked Luigi Valdarno?” asked the Italian hoarsely, brandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. We dared not move.  “My God, Poirot, this is awful. What shall we do?” I cried.  “You will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, Hastings. I can assure you that our friend will not shoot until I give the word.”  “Youse sure o’ dat, eh?” said the Italian, leering unpleasantly.  It was more than I was, but the woman turned to Poirot like a flash.  “What is it you want?”  Poirot bowed.  “I do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardt’s intelligence by telling her.”  With a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone.  “They are stitched in the lining of that.”  “Clever,” murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the door. “Good evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New York whilst you make your getaway.”  “Whatta fool!” roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he fired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as I flung myself upon him.  But the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirot’s voice rose in mild reproof.  “Never will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would I permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, _mon ami_.” This to the Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof: “See now, what I have done for you. I have saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our beautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and front. Straight into the arms of the police they will go. Is not that a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room now. But be careful—be very careful. I——Ah, he is gone! And my friend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all so simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several hundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the Robinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that singled them out from the rest—at practically a glance. Their appearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!”  “But there’s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,” I cried. “It’s quite a common name.”  “Ah! _Sapristi_, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and her husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New York, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the Camorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their track. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler? They offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of young couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be several Robinsons. It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look at the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will realize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives. He knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over, vengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me to the real Mrs. Robinson—that delightful and truthful creature! What will they think when they find their flat has been broken into! We must hurry back. Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends arriving.”  A mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker.  “How did you know this address?” I asked as I followed Poirot out into the hall. “Oh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson followed when she left the other flat.”  “_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last. Now for a little surprise for Japp.”  Softly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat’s head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing “Miaow.”  The Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another man, jumped in spite of himself.  “Oh, it’s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!” he exclaimed, as Poirot’s head followed that of the cat. “Let us in, moosior.”  “You have our friends safe and sound?”  “Yes, we’ve got the birds all right. But they hadn’t got the goods with them.”  “I see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with Hastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat.”  “For the Lord’s sake, have you gone completely balmy?”  “The cat,” declaimed Poirot, “was worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp. To speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I know, considered polite in England. But the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate. I refer to the lining.”  With a sudden grunt, the second man seized the cat from Poirot’s hand.  “Oh, I forgot to introduce you,” said Japp. “Mr. Poirot, this is Mr. Burt of the United States Secret Service.”  The American’s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for. He held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. Then he rose to the occasion.  “Pleased to meet you,” said Mr. Burt.       IV     The Mystery of Hunter’s Lodge   “After all,” murmured Poirot, “it is possible that I shall not die this time.”  Coming from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism. I myself had been the first sufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head muffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions. His eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece.  “Yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “Once more shall I be myself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers! Figure to yourself, _mon ami_, that I have a little paragraph to myself in _Society Gossip_. But yes! Here it is! ‘Go it—criminals—all out! Hercule Poirot—and believe me, girls, he’s some Hercules!—our own pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’Cause why? ’Cause he’s got _la grippe_ himself’!”  I laughed.  “Good for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character. And fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest during this time.”  “That is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me with any regret.”  Our landlady stuck her head in at the door.  “There’s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain. Seeing as he was in a great to-do—and with all that quite the gentleman—I brought up ’is card.”  She handed me the bit of pasteboard. “Mr. Roger Havering,” I read.  Poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently pulled forth “Who’s Who.” Poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly.  “Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb.”  “H’m!” I said. “I rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at the Frivolity—only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember she married some young man about town just before the War.”  “Would it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our visitor’s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.”  Roger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart appearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently labouring under great agitation.  “Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s partner, I understand. It is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.”  “I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is ill in bed—influenza.”  His face fell.  “Dear me, that is a great blow to me.”  “The matter on which you want to consult him is serious?”  “My God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was foully murdered last night.”  “Here in London?”  “No, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to come round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.”  “If you will excuse me a minute,” I said, struck by a sudden idea.  I rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with the situation. He took any further words out of my mouth.  “I see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why not? You should know my methods by now. All I ask is that you should report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any instructions I may wire you.”  To this I willingly agreed.     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   An hour later I was sitting opposite Mr. Havering in a first-class carriage on the Midland Railway, speeding rapidly away from London.  “To begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunter’s Lodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is only a small shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors. Our real home is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town for the season. Hunter’s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional week-end. Of course, during the shooting season, we take down some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss Pace of New York), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. He never got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me. Of course I am a poor man, and my uncle was a rich one—in other words, he paid the piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really hard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously together. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to Derbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton, the housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday evening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle remained on. This morning I received this telegram.” He handed it over to me:  “Come at once uncle Harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do come—Zoe.”  “Then, as yet you know no details?”  “No, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the police are in charge.”  It was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station of Elmer’s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors.  “A lonely place,” I observed with a shiver.  Havering nodded.  “I shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.”  We unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.  “Japp!” I ejaculated.  The Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion.  “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.”  “My wife——”  “I’ve seen your good lady, sir—and the housekeeper. I won’t keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.”  “I know nothing as yet as to what——”  “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly. “But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming. What have you done with the little man, by the way, Captain Hastings?”  “He’s ill in bed with influenza.”  “Is he now? I’m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart without the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?”  And on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black.  “Mr. Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night.”  “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly-lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.”  “What became of the man?”  “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.”  “And then?”  “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.”  “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?”  The housekeeper reflected.  “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.”  “I see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?”  “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?”  “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.”  “Very good, sir.”  I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels.  Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality.  I introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.  “Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur Poirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair?”  “Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man arrived?”  “It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.”  “Your husband had already left for London?”  “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.”  “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?”  “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.”  “Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?”  “Absolutely. Most normal in every way.”  “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?”  “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.”  “What did your uncle say?”  “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle”—her voice faltered—“had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.”  I nodded approval.  “Now, as to the weapon?”  “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.”  “May I go to the gun-room?”  “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been removed.”  She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone.  I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to waste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station.  I found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see the body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man, typically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.  “Turned away for a moment,” remarked Japp, “and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed over to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall.”  “What do you think of the case?” I asked, as we left the gruesome chamber behind us.  “Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!” noting my exclamation of astonishment. “Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques. All hushed up of course. Then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle about, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his favour. Yes, I’d got my eye on him, and that’s why I wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about 10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right—why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!”  “Ah, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that beard?”  Japp winked.  “I think it grew pretty fast—grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean-shaven. Yes, it’s amongst Mr. Pace’s American associates that we’ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right, but I’m sorry Mrs. Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.”  I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter.  The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question. And, thirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it.  All this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst I was at breakfast the following morning:  “Of course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic.”  It seemed to me that Poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious. I also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case. His request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was able to.  At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot:  “Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.”  Dumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath.  “He’s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there’s something in it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don’t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up right away, and take another look at her.”  But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts.  From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could:  “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne’s Agency in Mount Street—a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet woman.”  The thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?  I wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency.  Poirot’s reply was prompt:  “Useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there.”  Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to Hunter’s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the station on the chance of its being required. Taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on the fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention that inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot’s prognostication. No such woman as “Mrs. Middleton” had ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected.  Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection.  “_Mon ami_ Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?”  “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.”  “It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.”  “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.”  “Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.”  “You know? How did you find out?”  “Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth. See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His nephew is also known to be—shall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre? Point No. 3.”  “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.”  “_Précisément_—and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at 6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left, or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.”  “Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.”  “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.”  “She will be found.”  “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.”  “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.”  “And what was her part?”  “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.”  “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.”  “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?”  “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.”  “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?”  “No, that was Roger Havering’s job—but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner—you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that!—reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.”  “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet——”  “And yet it is true. _Bien sur_, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can—I have written him fully—but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or _le bon Dieu_, whichever you prefer.”  “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him.  “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, _croyez-moi!_”  Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction.  Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied.       V    The Million Dollar Bond Robbery  “What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” I observed one morning, laying aside the newspaper. “Poirot, let us forsake the science of detection, and take to crime instead!”  “You are on the—how do you say it?—get-rich-quick tack, eh, _mon ami_?”  “Well, look at this last _coup_, the million dollars’ worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the _Olympia_.”  “If it were not for the _mal de mer_, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured Poirot dreamily.  “Yes, indeed,” I said enthusiastically. “Some of them must be perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant, the palm courts—really, it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea.”  “Me, I always know when I am on the sea,” said Poirot sadly. “And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the _haute noblesse_ of the criminal world!”  I laughed.  “So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?”  The landlady interrupted us.  “A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card.”  The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot, after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to admit her.  In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty, with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and perfectly composed in manner.  “Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain Hastings, who aids me in my little problems.”  “I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur Poirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself. “I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the _Olympia_.” Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for she continued quickly: “You are doubtless asking yourself what I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.”  “Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway——”  “Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.”  “Who is his uncle?”  “Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish Bank.”  “Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?”  “Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau.”  “A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?”  “No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.”  Poirot made a grimace.  “But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the _Olympia_! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr. Ridgeway.”  “I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.”  We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a taxi.  Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers. He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much over thirty.  Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.  “You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,” she said. “Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.”  Ridgeway looked very astonished.  “Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,” he said, as he shook hands. “But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of consulting you about my—our trouble.”  “I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,” said Miss Farquhar meekly.  “So you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a smile. “I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.”  Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring.  “Well, well,” said Poirot. “Let us lunch, and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips.”  Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot took up the thread with a question.  “What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen, Mr. Ridgeway?”  He laughed rather bitterly.  “The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.”  “But I understood that it had been opened with a key?”  “That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t. And, in the end, they must have got it unlocked somehow or other.”  “Curious,” said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light I knew so well. “Very curious! They waste much, much time trying to prise it open, and then—_sapristi!_ they find that they have the key all the time—for each of Hubbs’s locks are unique.”  “That’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. It never left me day or night.”  “You are sure of that?”  “I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock?”  “Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I ask you one more question: _Are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked?_”  Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated apologetically.  “Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them? How did he manage to get ashore with them?”  “Ah!” cried Ridgeway. “That’s just it. How? Word was passed to the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb!”  “And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?”  “Certainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on board—and anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the _Olympia’s_ arrival, long before I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he bought some of them even before the _Olympia_ got in. But you can’t send bonds by wireless.”  “Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?”  “Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say I stole them myself.”  “But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked Poirot gently.  “Yes.”  The young man stared at him in a puzzled manner.  “You do not catch my meaning, I see,” said Poirot, smiling enigmatically. “Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank.”  Ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it.  “Send this in and my uncle will see you at once.”  Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the London and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway’s card, we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us. They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven.  “I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said Mr. Vavasour. “Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe.”  “I am sure of it,” said Poirot politely. “You will permit a few questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered it from Hubbs’s?”  “I ordered it myself,” said Mr. Shaw. “I would not trust to any clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the other two are held by my colleague and myself.”  “And no clerk has had access to them?”  Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. “I think I am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the 23rd,” said Mr. Vavasour. “My colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight ago—in fact on the very day that Philip left us. He has only just recovered.”  “Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said Mr. Shaw ruefully. “But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything.”  Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew. Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar missions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out.  “I am disappointed,” said Poirot, as we emerged into the street.  “You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.”  “It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, _mon ami_. I do not expect to find in a Bank manager a ‘keen financier with an eagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am disappointed in the case—it is too easy!”  “Easy?”  “Yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?”  “You know who stole the bonds?”  “I do.”  “But then—we must—why——”  “Do not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going to do anything at present.”  “But why? What are you waiting for?”  “For the _Olympia_. She is due on her return trip from New York on Tuesday.”  “But if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.”  “To a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, _mon ami_, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I wait—_eh bien_ to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is perfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly gifted by the good God—the Inspector McNeil, for instance—it would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself.”  “Good Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I’d give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself—just for once. You’re so confoundedly conceited!”  “Do not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there are times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties of greatness!”  The little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that I was forced to laugh.  Tuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of the L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicions—or certainties. He contented himself with expressing surprise that I, too, was not equally _au fait_ with the situation. I disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference.  Once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of Poirot’s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd.  “An elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. A great invalid, hardly moved out of his cabin.”  The description appeared to tally with one Mr. Ventnor who had occupied the cabin C 24 which was next to that of Philip Ridgeway. Although unable to see how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnor’s existence and personal appearance, I was keenly excited.  “Tell me,” I cried, “was this gentleman one of the first to land when you got to New York?” The steward shook his head.  “No, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat.”  I retired crestfallen, and observed Poirot grinning at me. He thanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our departure.  “It’s all very well,” I remarked heatedly, “but that last answer must have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!”  “As usual, you see nothing, Hastings. That last answer is, on the contrary, the coping-stone of my theory.”  I flung up my hands in despair.  “I give it up.”     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   When we were in the train, speeding towards London, Poirot wrote busily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.  “This is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland Yard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I have asked Miss Esmée Farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us.”  “What about Ridgeway?”  “What about him?” asked Poirot with a twinkle.  “Why, you surely don’t think—you can’t——”  “The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a matter of fact I _did_ think. If Ridgeway had been the thief—which was perfectly possible—the case would have been charming; a piece of neat methodical work.”  “But not so charming for Miss Farquhar.”  “Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now, Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes, as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore——”  “Yes, but we know——”  “_You_ may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since it seemed incredible, it _was_ incredible. Two possibilities remain: it was hidden on board—also rather difficult—or it was thrown overboard.”  “With a cork on it, do you mean?”  “Without a cork.”  I stared.  “But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been sold in New York.”  “I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that leads us?”  “Where we were when we started.”  “_Jamais de la vie!_ If the package was thrown overboard, and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in London.”  “Yes, but then——”  Poirot waved an impatient hand.  “Permit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the morning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after the _Olympia_ gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody listens to, actually _before_ she gets in. Supposing then, that they have never been on the _Olympia_ at all? Is there any other way they could get to New York? Yes. The _Gigantic_ leaves Southampton on the same day as the _Olympia_, and she holds the record for the Atlantic. Mailed by the _Gigantic_, the bonds would be in New York the day before the _Olympia_ arrived. All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one. _Très bien_, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as the _Olympia_ is in, but some one must travel on the _Olympia_ to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery.”  “But why?”  “Because if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy, suspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft, really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in New York and returns by the first boat available.”  “But who—which was he?”  “The man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock, the man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the country—_enfin_, that ‘stodgy’ old man, Mr. Shaw! There are criminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are. Mademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?”  And, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek!       VI     The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb   I have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.  Hard upon the discovery of the Tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen by Lord Carnarvon, Sir John Willard and Mr. Bleibner of New York, pursuing their excavations not far from Cairo, in the vicinity of the Pyramids of Gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral chambers. The greatest interest was aroused by their discovery. The Tomb appeared to be that of King Men-her-Ra, one of those shadowy kings of the Eighth Dynasty, when the Old Kingdom was falling to decay. Little was known about this period, and the discoveries were fully reported in the newspapers.  An event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure.  The more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the British Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh zest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue.  A fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York. The “Curse of Men-her-Ra” was the talk of the day, and the magic power of dead and gone Egypt was exalted to a fetish point.  It was then that Poirot received a brief note from Lady Willard, widow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at her house in Kensington Square. I accompanied him.  Lady Willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. Her haggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief.  “It is kind of you to have come so promptly, Monsieur Poirot.”  “I am at your service, Lady Willard. You wished to consult me?”  “You are, I am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective that I wish to consult you. You are a man of original views, I know, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me, Monsieur Poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?”  Poirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. He seemed to be considering. Finally he said:  “Let us not misunderstand each other, Lady Willard. It is not a general question that you are asking me there. It has a personal application, has it not? You are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband?”  “That is so,” she admitted.  “You want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?”  “I want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? Three deaths, Monsieur Poirot—each one explicable taken by itself, but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all within a month of the opening of the tomb! It may be mere superstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science. The fact remains—three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly afraid. It may not yet be the end.”  “For whom do you fear?”  “For my son. When the news of my husband’s death came I was ill. My son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He brought the—the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite of my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of excavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but, Monsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead King is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking nonsense——”  “No, indeed, Lady Willard,” said Poirot quickly. “I, too, believe in the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world has ever known.”  I looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot with being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in earnest.  “What you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will do my utmost to keep him from harm.”  “Yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?”  “In volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many ways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts, that I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted Egyptologist, hadn’t he?”  “Yes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject.”  “But Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?”  “Oh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to interest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition.”  “And the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the party at all?”  “I do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I read of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner can have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any relations.”  “Who are the other members of the party?”  “Well, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the British Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New York; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband’s devoted native servant.”  “Do you remember the name of the American secretary?”  “Harper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr. Bleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.”  “Thank you, Lady Willard.”  “If there is anything else——?”  “For the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured that I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.”  They were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard wince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he had not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her.  For my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject as we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest.  “But yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not underrate the force of superstition.”  “What are we going to do about it?”  “_Toujours pratique_, the good Hastings! _Eh bien_, to begin with we are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr. Bleibner’s death.”  He duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young Rupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had been a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea islands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my mind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to Egypt. “I’ve a good friend there I can borrow from,” he had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had returned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir John Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had committed suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He referred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead.  A shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more modern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with his uncle—preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard receives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted by his crime. The news of his uncle’s death reaches him. He realizes how unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes his own life.  I outlined my solution to Poirot. He was interested.  “It is ingenious what you have thought of there—decidedly it is ingenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the fatal influence of the Tomb.”  I shrugged my shoulders.  “You still think that has something to do with it?”  “So much so, _mon ami_, that we start for Egypt to-morrow.”  “What?” I cried, astonished.  “I have said it.” An expression of conscious heroism spread over Poirot’s face. Then he groaned. “But, oh,” he lamented, “the sea! The hateful sea!”     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   It was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of misery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller. Our four days’ voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to him. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self, even his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo and had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the shadow of the Pyramids.  The charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot. Dressed precisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel.  “And my boots,” he wailed. “Regard them, Hastings. My boots, of the neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the sand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which outrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to become limp—but limp!”  “Look at the Sphinx,” I urged. “Even I can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales.”  Poirot looked at it discontentedly.  “It has not the air happy,” he declared. “How could it, half-buried in sand in that untidy fashion. Ah, this cursed sand!”  “Come, now, there’s a lot of sand in Belgium,” I reminded him, mindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “_les dunes impeccables_” as the guide-book had phrased it.  “Not in Brussels,” declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids thoughtfully. “It is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid and geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they plant them in rows!”  I cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start for the camp. We were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were patiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman.  I pass over the spectacle of Poirot on a camel. He started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and invocations to the Virgin Mary and every Saint in the calendar. In the end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey. I must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur. I was stiff for several days.  At last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with a grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet us.  “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I’m sorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans.”  Poirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush, stayed its course.  “Not another death?” he breathed.  “Yes.”  “Sir Guy Willard?” I cried.  “No, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.”  “And the cause?” demanded Poirot.  “Tetanus.”  I blanched. All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil, subtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing I were the next?  “_Mon Dieu_,” said Poirot, in a very low voice, “I do not understand this. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it was tetanus?”  “I believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.”  “Ah, of course, you are not the doctor.”  “My name is Tosswill.”  This, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as being a minor official at the British Museum. There was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy.  “If you will come with me,” continued Dr. Tosswill, “I will take you to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive.”  We were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside.  “Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,” said Tosswill.  The youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother. He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and that fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made him look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain.  He introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man of thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and Mr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles.  After a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out, and Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and Dr. Ames.  “Please ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,” said Willard. “We are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters, but it isn’t—it can’t be, anything but coincidence.”  There was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly.  “Your heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?”  “Rather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is going on. Make up your mind to that.”  Poirot wheeled round on the other.  “What have you to say to that, _monsieur le docteur_?”  “Well,” drawled the doctor, “I’m not for quitting myself.”  Poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.  “Then, _évidemment_, we must find out just how we stand. When did Mr. Schneider’s death take place?”  “Three days ago.”  “You are sure it was tetanus?”  “Dead sure.”  “It couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for instance?”  “No, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you’re getting at. But it was a clear case of tetanus.”  “Did you not inject anti-serum?”  “Certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “Every conceivable thing that could be done was tried.”  “Had you the anti-serum with you?”  “No. We procured it from Cairo.”  “Have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?”  “No, not one.”  “Are you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to tetanus?”  “Absolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned, and septicæmia set in. It sounds pretty much the same to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely different.”  “Then we have four deaths—all totally dissimilar, one heart failure, one blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.”  “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot.”  “Are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together?”  “I don’t quite understand you?”  “I will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?”  The doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment.  “You’re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you’ve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk?”  “Absolute nonsense,” muttered Willard angrily.  Poirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his green cat’s eyes.  “So you do not believe it, _monsieur le docteur_?”  “No, sir, I do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “I am a scientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.”  “Was there no science then in Ancient Egypt?” asked Poirot softly. He did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment. “No, no, do not answer me, but tell me this. What do the native workmen think?”  “I guess,” said Dr. Ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads, natives aren’t going to be far behind. I’ll admit that they’re getting what you might call scared—but they’ve no cause to be.”  “I wonder,” said Poirot non-committally.  Sir Guy leant forward.  “Surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in—oh, but the thing’s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you think that.”  For answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket—an ancient tattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, _The Magic of the Egyptians and Chaldeans_. Then, wheeling round, he strode out of the tent. The doctor stared at me.  “What is his little idea?”  The phrase, so familiar on Poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came from another.  “I don’t know exactly,” I confessed. “He’s got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.”  I went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced young man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner’s secretary.  “No,” Mr. Harper was saying, “I’ve only been six months with the expedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner’s affairs pretty well.”  “Can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?”  “He turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I’d never met him before, but some of the others had—Ames, I think, and Schneider. The old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. They were at it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘Not a cent,’ the old man shouted. ‘Not one cent now or when I’m dead. I intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my life’s work. I’ve been talking it over with Mr. Schneider to-day.’ And a bit more of the same. Young Bleibner lit out for Cairo right away.”  “Was he in perfectly good health at the time?”  “The old man?”  “No, the young one.”  “I believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But it couldn’t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.”  “One thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?”  “So far as we know, he has not.”  “Are you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?”  “No, sir, I am not. I’m for New York as soon as I can square up things here. You may laugh if you like, but I’m not going to be this blasted old Men-her-Ra’s next victim. He’ll get me if I stop here.”  The young man wiped the perspiration from his brow.  Poirot turned away. Over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile:  “Remember, he got one of his victims in New York.”  “Oh, hell!” said Mr. Harper forcibly.  “That young man is nervous,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “He is on the edge, but absolutely on the edge.”  I glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me nothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were taken round the excavations. The principal finds had been removed to Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting. The enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that I detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we entered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before joining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in Arabic. Poirot stopped.  “You are Hassan, the late Sir John Willard’s servant?”  “I served my Lord Sir John, now I serve his son.” He took a step nearer to us and lowered his voice. “You are a wise one, they say, learned in dealing with evil spirits. Let the young master depart from here. There is evil in the air around us.”  And with an abrupt gesture, not waiting for a reply, he strode away.  “Evil in the air,” muttered Poirot. “Yes, I feel it.”  Our meal was hardly a cheerful one. The floor was left to Dr. Tosswill, who discoursed at length upon Egyptian antiquities. Just as we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by the arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents. It was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure I had seen carved on the walls of the tomb.  My blood literally froze at the sight.  “_Mon Dieu!_” murmured Poirot, crossing himself vigorously. “Anubis, the jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.”  “Some one is hoaxing us,” cried Dr. Tosswill, rising indignantly to his feet.  “It went into your tent, Harper,” muttered Sir Guy, his face dreadfully pale.  “No,” said Poirot, shaking his head, “into that of the Dr. Ames.”  The doctor stared at him incredulously; then, repeating Dr. Tosswill’s words, he cried:  “Some one is hoaxing us. Come, we’ll soon catch the fellow.”  He dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition. I followed him, but, search as we would, we could find no trace of any living soul having passed that way. We returned, somewhat disturbed in mind, to find Poirot taking energetic measures, in his own way, to ensure his personal safety. He was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand. I recognized the five-pointed star or Pentagon many times repeated. As was his wont, Poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general, White Magic as opposed to Black, with various references to the Ka and the Book of the Dead thrown in.  It appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in Dr. Tosswill, who drew me aside, literally snorting with rage.  “Balderdash, sir,” he exclaimed angrily. “Pure balderdash. The man’s an impostor. He doesn’t know the difference between the superstitions of the Middle Ages and the beliefs of Ancient Egypt. Never have I heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.”  I calmed the excited expert, and joined Poirot in the tent. My little friend was beaming cheerfully.  “We can now sleep in peace,” he declared happily. “And I can do with some sleep. My head, it aches abominably. Ah, for a good _tisane_!”  As though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and Hassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to Poirot. It proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately fond. Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert.  “A wonderful place,” I said aloud, “and a wonderful work. I can feel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel the charm?”  I got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was quickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude couch, his face horribly convulsed. Beside him was the empty cup. I rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to Dr. Ames’s tent.  “Dr. Ames!” I cried. “Come at once.”  “What’s the matter?” said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas.  “My friend. He’s ill. Dying. The camomile tea. Don’t let Hassan leave the camp.”  Like a flash the doctor ran to our tent. Poirot was lying as I left him.  “Extraordinary,” cried Ames. “Looks like a seizure—or—what did you say about something he drank?” He picked up the empty cup.  “Only I did not drink it!” said a placid voice.  We turned in amazement. Poirot was sitting up on the bed. He was smiling.  “No,” he said gently. “I did not drink it. While my good friend Hastings was apostrophizing the night, I took the opportunity of pouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. That little bottle will go to the analytical chemist. No”—as the doctor made a sudden movement—“as a sensible man, you will understand that violence will be of no avail. During Hastings’ brief absence to fetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah, quick, Hastings, hold him!”  I misunderstood Poirot’s anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung myself in front of him. But the doctor’s swift movement had another meaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds filled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.  “Another victim,” said Poirot gravely, “but the last. Perhaps it is the best way. He has three deaths on his head.”  “Dr. Ames?” I cried, stupefied. “But I thought you believed in some occult influence?”  “You misunderstood me, Hastings. What I meant was that I believe in the terrific force of superstition. Once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down to the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race. I suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct. The idea came to him, I imagine, with the death of Sir John Willard. A fury of superstition arose at once. As far as I could see, nobody could derive any particular profit from Sir John’s death. Mr. Bleibner was a different case. He was a man of great wealth. The information I received from New York contained several suggestive points. To begin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion of his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him to Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet he was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must have lent him the money.”  “All that was very thin,” I objected.  “But there was more. Hastings, there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can happen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘I am a leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.”  “What?” I ejaculated.  “It was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the South Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough. Ames was a former friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never dream of doubting his word. When I arrived here, my suspicions were divided between Harper and Dr. Ames, but I soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and I learnt from Harper that he was previously acquainted with young Bleibner. Doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. The latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth. It was easy for him to inoculate Mr. Bleibner with the deadly germs. Then the nephew, overcome with despair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot himself. Mr. Bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will. His fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.”  “And Mr. Schneider?”  “We cannot be sure. He knew young Bleibner too, remember, and may have suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought that a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen the coils of superstition. Furthermore, I will tell you an interesting psychological fact, Hastings. A murderer has always a strong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of it grows upon him. Hence my fears for young Willard. The figure of Anubis you saw to-night was Hassan, dressed up by my orders. I wanted to see if I could frighten the doctor. But it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him. I could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult. The little comedy I played for him did not deceive him. I suspected that he would endeavour to make me the next victim. Ah, but in spite of _la mer maudite_, the heat abominable, and the annoyances of the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!”  Poirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. Young Bleibner, some years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular will, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.”  The case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb of Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomb—a belief which, as Poirot pointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought.       VII    The Jewel Robbery at the _Grand Metropolitan_  “Poirot,” I said, “a change of air would do you good.”  “You think so, _mon ami_?”  “I am sure of it.”  “Eh—eh?” said my friend, smiling. “It is all arranged, then?”  “You will come?”  “Where do you propose to take me?”  “Brighton. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put me on to a very good thing, and—well, I have money to burn, as the saying goes. I think a week-end at the _Grand Metropolitan_ would do us all the good in the world.”  “Thank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to think of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth all the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes.”  I did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities. But his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance aside.  “Then, that’s all right,” I said hastily.  Saturday evening saw us dining at the _Grand Metropolitan_ in the midst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at Brighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels—worn sometimes with more love of display than good taste—were something magnificent.  “_Hein_, it is a sight this!” murmured Poirot. “This is the home of the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?”  “Supposed to be,” I replied. “But we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred with the Profiteering brush.”  Poirot gazed round him placidly.  “The sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains to crime, instead of to its detection. What a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction! Regard, Hastings, that stout woman by the pillar. She is, as you would say, plastered with gems.”  I followed his eyes.  “Why,” I exclaimed, “it’s Mrs. Opalsen.”  “You know her?”  “Slightly. Her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in the recent Oil boom.”  After dinner we ran across the Opalsens in the lounge, and I introduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended by having our coffee together.  Poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the lady’s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once.  “It’s a perfect hobby of mine, Mr. Poirot. I just _love_ jewellery. Ed knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me something new. You are interested in precious stones?”  “I have had a good deal to do with them one time and another, madame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world.”  He went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with bated breath.  “There now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “If it isn’t just like a play! You know, I’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them. I believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the world—the pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!”  “Oh, madame,” protested Poirot, “you are too amiable. Pray do not derange yourself!”  “Oh, but I’d like to show it to you.”  The buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her husband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly.  “Madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace,” explained the latter.  “Oh, the pearls!” Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. “Well, they _are_ worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the money’s there all right; I could get what I paid for them any day—perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are now. Money’s confoundedly tight in the City. All this infernal E.P.D.” He rambled on, launching into technicalities where I could not follow him.  He was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured something in his ear.  “Eh—what? I’ll come at once. Not taken ill, is she? Excuse me, gentlemen.”  He left us abruptly. Poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny Russian cigarettes. Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged the empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the result.  The minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return.  “Curious,” I remarked, at length. “I wonder when they will come back.”  Poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said thoughtfully:  “They will not come back.”  “Why?”  “Because, my friend, something has happened.”  “What sort of thing? How do you know?” I asked curiously.  Poirot smiled.  “A few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs. He was much agitated. The lift-boy is deep in talk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times, but he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are _distrait_; and to make a waiter _distrait_——” Poirot shook his head with an air of finality. “The affair must indeed be of the first magnitude. Ah, it is as I thought! Here come the police.”  Two men had just entered the hotel—one in uniform, the other in plain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered upstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting.  “Mr. Opalsen’s compliments, and would you step upstairs.”  Poirot sprang nimbly to his feet. One would have said that he awaited the summons. I followed with no less alacrity.  The Opalsens’ apartments were situated on the first floor. After knocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the summons, “Come in!” A strange scene met our eyes. The room was Mrs. Opalsen’s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an arm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. She presented an extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr. Opalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials stood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An hotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the fire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman, obviously Mrs. Opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands, with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress.  Into this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling. Immediately, with an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang from her chair towards him.  “There now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do. It was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I’ve a feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.”  “Calm yourself, I pray of you, madame.” Poirot patted her hand soothingly. “Reassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot will aid you!”  Mr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector.  “There will be no objection to my—er—calling in this gentleman, I suppose?”  “None at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete indifference. “Perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just let us have the facts?”  Mrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her chair.  “Seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself.”  Thus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began.  “I came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot here to see. The chambermaid and Célestine were both in the room as usual——”  “Excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?”  Mr. Opalsen explained.  “I make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless Célestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room in the morning while Célestine is present, and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise she never enters the room.”  “Well, as I was saying,” continued Mrs. Opalsen, “I came up. I went to the drawer here,”—she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of the knee-hole dressing-table—“took out my jewel-case and unlocked it. It seemed quite as usual—but the pearls were not there!”  The inspector had been busy with his notebook. “When had you last seen them?” he asked.  “They were there when I went down to dinner.”  “You are sure?”  “Quite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in the end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the jewel-case.”  “Who locked up the jewel-case?”  “I did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.” She held it up as she spoke.  The inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders.  “The thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The lock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you’d locked the jewel-case?”  “I put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.”  “You didn’t lock the drawer?”  “No, I never do. My maid remains in the room till I come up, so there’s no need.”  The inspector’s face grew graver.  “Am I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner, and that since then _the maid has not left the room_?”  Suddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her, Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and, flinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent French.  The suggestion was infamous! That she should be suspected of robbing Madame! The police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible! But Monsieur, who was a Frenchman—  “A Belgian,” interjected Poirot, but Célestine paid no attention to the correction.  Monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. She had never liked her—a bold, red-faced thing—a born thief. She had said from the first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over her too, when she was doing Madame’s room! Let those idiots of policemen search her, and if they did not find Madame’s pearls on her it would be very surprising!  Although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French, Célestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened angrily.  “If that foreign woman’s saying I took the pearls, it’s a lie!” she declared heatedly. “I never so much as saw them.”  “Search her!” screamed the other. “You will find it is as I say.”  “You’re a liar—do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon her. “Stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then you were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat watching a mouse.”  The inspector looked across inquiringly at Célestine. “Is that true? Didn’t you leave the room at all?”  “I did not actually leave her alone,” admitted Célestine reluctantly, “but I went into my own room through the door here twice—once to fetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have done it then.”  “You wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “Just popped out and in again. I’d be glad if the police _would_ search me. _I’ve nothing to be afraid of_.”  At this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to it. His face brightened when he saw who it was.  “Ah!” he said. “That’s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our female searchers, and she’s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldn’t mind going into the room next door.”  He looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head, the searcher following her closely.  The French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking round the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a sketch.  [A sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor.]  “Where does that door lead?” he inquired, nodding his head towards the one by the window.  “Into the next apartment, I believe,” said the inspector. “It’s bolted, anyway, on this side.”  Poirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and tried it again.  “And on the other side as well,” he remarked. “Well, that seems to rule out that.”  He walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn.  “And again—nothing. Not even a balcony outside.”  “Even if there were,” said the inspector impatiently, “I don’t see how that would help us, if the maid never left the room.”  “_Évidemment_,” said Poirot, not disconcerted. “As Mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room——”  He was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher.  “Nothing,” said the latter laconically.  “I should hope not, indeed,” said the chambermaid virtuously. “And that French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girl’s character!”  “There, there, my girl; that’s all right,” said the inspector, opening the door. “Nobody suspects you. You go along and get on with your work.”  The chambermaid went unwillingly.  “Going to search _her_?” she demanded, pointing at Célestine.  “Yes, yes!” He shut the door on her and turned the key.  Célestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn. A few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on her.  The inspector’s face grew graver.  “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the same, miss.” He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. “I’m sorry, madam, but all the evidence points that way. If she’s not got them on her, they’re hidden somewhere about the room.”  Célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot’s arm. The latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. She looked up at him doubtfully.  “_Si, si, mon enfant_—I assure you it is better not to resist.” Then he turned to the inspector. “You permit, monsieur? A little experiment—purely for my own satisfaction.”  “Depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally.  Poirot addressed Célestine once more.  “You have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton. Whereabouts was it?”  “On the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.”  “And the scissors?”  “They also.”  “Would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to repeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work, you say?”  Célestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed into the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of drawers, and returned.  Poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand.  “Again, if you please, mademoiselle.”  At the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his pocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket.  “Thank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,”—he bowed to the inspector—“for your courtesy.”  The inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness. Célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by the woman and the plain-clothes official.  Then, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to work to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards, completely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked on sceptically.  “You really think you will find them?”  “Yes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadn’t time to take them out of the room. The lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans. No, they’re here right enough. One of the two must have hidden them—and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so.”  “More than unlikely—impossible!” said Poirot quietly.  “Eh?” The inspector stared.  Poirot smiled modestly.  “I will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in your hand—with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed Mademoiselle’s movements—her first absence from the room was of twelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions. Madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case. I thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say ‘Go!’”  “Go!” I said.  With almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in the lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and locked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to again. His movements were like lightning.  “Well, _mon ami_?” he demanded of me breathlessly.  “Forty-six seconds,” I replied.  “You see?” He looked round. “There would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.”  “Then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with satisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid’s bedroom next door.  Poirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at Mr. Opalsen.  “This necklace—it was, without doubt, insured?”  Mr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question.  “Yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.”  “But what does that matter?” broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. “It’s my necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.”  “I comprehend, madame,” said Poirot soothingly. “I comprehend perfectly. To _la femme_ sentiment is everything—is it not so? But monsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact.”  “Of course, of course,” said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly. “Still——”  He was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He came in dangling something from his fingers.  With a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was a changed woman.  “Oh, oh, my necklace!”  She clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round.  “Where was it?” demanded Opalsen.  “Maid’s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene.”  “You permit, madame?” said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from her and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow.  “I’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time being,” said the inspector. “We shall want it for the charge. But it shall be returned to you as soon as possible.”  Mr. Opalsen frowned.  “Is that necessary?”  “I’m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.”  “Oh, let him take it, Ed!” cried his wife. “I’d feel safer if he did. I shouldn’t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed it of her.”  “There, there, my dear, don’t take on so.”  I felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot.  “Shall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer needed.”  Once outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise, he remarked:  “I should rather like to see the room next door.”  The door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a large double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably, and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window.  “The _service_ leaves to be desired,” he observed dryly.  He was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have fallen into a brown study.  “Well?” I demanded impatiently. “What did we come in here for?”  He started.  “_Je vous demande pardon, mon ami_. I wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also.”  “Well,” I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left, “it _is_ bolted.”  Poirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking.  “And, anyway,” I continued, “what does it matter? The case is over. I wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it was the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that inspector couldn’t go wrong over.”  Poirot shook his head.  “The case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls.”  “But the maid did!”  “Why do you say that?”  “Why,” I stammered, “they were found—actually in her mattress.”  “Ta, ta, ta!” said Poirot impatiently. “Those were not the pearls.”  “What?”  “Imitation, _mon ami_.”  The statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly.  “The good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently there will be a fine hullabaloo!”  “Come!” I cried, dragging at his arm.  “Where?”  “We must tell the Opalsens at once.”  “I think not.”  “But that poor woman——”  “_Eh bien_; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe.”  “But the thief may escape with them!”  “As usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know that the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were not the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date?”  “Oh!” I said, bewildered.  “Exactly,” said Poirot, beaming. “We start again.”  He led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though considering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor, stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in the middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.  “Excuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen’s room.”  The woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage again. Mr. Opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor, its door facing that of his wife’s room. The chambermaid unlocked it with her pass-key, and we entered.  As she was about to depart Poirot detained her.  “One moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen a card like this?”  He held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully.  “No, sir, I can’t say I have. But, anyway, the valet has most to do with the gentlemen’s rooms.”  “I see. Thank you.”  Poirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to reflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head.  “Ring the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the valet.”  I obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied the waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through its contents.  In a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put the same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the response was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among Mr. Opalsen’s belongings. Poirot thanked him, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive glance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the floor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot’s thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again:  “And the necklace was heavily insured. . . .”  “Poirot,” I cried,  “I see——”  “You see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “As usual, nothing at all! It is incredible—but there it is. Let us return to our own apartments.”  We did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot effected a rapid change of clothing.  “I go to London to-night,” he explained. “It is imperative.”  “What?”  “Absolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave little grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I shall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!”  “You’ll come a cropper one of these days,” I observed, rather disgusted by his vanity.  “Do not be enraged, I beg of you, _mon ami_. I count on you to do me a service—of your friendship.”  “Of course,” I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. “What is it?”  “The sleeve of my coat that I have taken off—will you brush it? See you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?”  “No, I didn’t.”  “You should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the powder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it on my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore—false to all my principles.”  “But what was the powder?” I asked, not particularly interested in Poirot’s principles.  “Not the poison of the Borgias,” replied Poirot, with a twinkle. “I see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French chalk.”  “French chalk?”  “Yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.”  I laughed.  “You old sinner! I thought you were working up to something exciting.”  “Au revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!”  The door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of affection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the clothes-brush.     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   The next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a stroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel. In the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us, and it was past eight when I got back to the _Grand Metropolitan_.  The first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more diminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in a state of placid satisfaction.  “_Mon ami_ Hastings!” he cried, and sprang to meet me. “Embrace me, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!”  Luckily, the embrace was merely figurative—not a thing one is always sure of with Poirot.  “Do you mean——” I began.  “Just wonderful, I call it!” said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over her fat face. “Didn’t I tell you, Ed, that if he couldn’t get back my pearls nobody would?”  “You did, my dear, you did. And you were right.”  I looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance.  “My friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside. Seat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended.”  “Ended?”  “But yes. They are arrested.”  “Who are arrested?”  “The chambermaid and the valet, _parbleu_! You did not suspect? Not with my parting hint about the French chalk?”  “You said cabinet-makers used it.”  “Certainly they do—to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that be? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eye—not even to the eye of Hercule Poirot.  “Listen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room next door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the jewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the door. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits his time. Célestine leaves the room again, and—pst!—in a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer.  “Madame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands to be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and leaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the French girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid—a master stroke, _ça!_”  “But what did you go to London for?”  “You remember the card?”  “Certainly. It puzzled me—and puzzles me still. I thought——”  I hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen.  Poirot laughed heartily.  “_Une blague!_ For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with a specially prepared surface—for finger-prints. I went straight to Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid the facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved to be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’ for some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested, and the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. A clever pair, but they failed in _method_. Have I not told you, Hastings, at least thirty-six times, that without method——”  “At least thirty-six thousand times!” I interrupted. “But where did their ‘method’ break down?”  “_Mon ami_, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valet—but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room undusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on the little table near the communicating door, it left a square mark——”  “I remember,” I cried.  “Before, I was undecided. Then—I _knew_!” There was a moment’s silence.  “And I’ve got my pearls,” said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek chorus.  “Well,” I said, “I’d better have some dinner.” Poirot accompanied me.  “This ought to mean kudos for you,” I observed.  “_Pas du tout_,” replied Poirot tranquilly. “Japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them. But”—he tapped his pocket—“I have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you, my friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we return here next week-end—at my expense this time?”       VIII     The Kidnapped Prime Minister   Now that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I think I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.  One evening after dinner—I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation” was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies—my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand.  I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day—no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek.  I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. “Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent.  He was more than England’s Prime Minister—he _was_ England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain.  Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention.  “In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease—he is not good—I remove him—so!” He waved his sponge.  I smiled as I lit another cigarette.  “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two.  “I assist a—how do you call it?—‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.”  I laughed.  “At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.”  “I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate MacAdam?”  “_Enfantillage!_” replied Poirot promptly. “One can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle—never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.”  “It was very near succeeding this time,” I reminded him.  Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him.  “They won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very important.”  “Let them mount,” said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers.  In a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage than Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his companion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet, and, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister.  “Monsieur Poirot?” said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend bowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. “My business is private.”  “You may speak freely before Captain Hastings,” said my friend, nodding to me to remain. “He has not all the gifts, no! But I answer for his discretion.”  Lord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly:  “Oh, come on—don’t let’s beat about the bush! As far as I can see, the whole of England will know the hole we’re in soon enough. Time’s everything.”  “Pray be seated, messieurs,” said Poirot politely. “Will you take the big chair, _milord_?”  Lord Estair started slightly. “You know me?”  Poirot smiled. “Certainly. I read the little papers with the pictures. How should I not know you?”  “Monsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.”  “You have the word of Hercule Poirot—I can say no more!” said my friend grandiloquently.  “It concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.”  “We’re up a tree!” interposed Mr. Dodge.  “The injury is serious, then?” I asked.  “What injury?”  “The bullet wound.”  “Oh, that!” cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. “That’s old history.”  “As my colleague says,” continued Lord Estair, “that affair is over and done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much for the second attempt.”  “There has been a second attempt, then?”  “Yes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime Minister has disappeared.”  “What?”  “He has been kidnapped!”  “Impossible!” I cried, stupefied.  Poirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut.  “Unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,” continued his lordship.  Poirot looked at Mr. Dodge. “You said just now, monsieur, that time was everything. What did you mean by that?”  The two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said:  “You have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied Conference?”  My friend nodded.  “For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow—Thursday—evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results—possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.”  Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?”  “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.”  “And the Conference is to be held?”  “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.”  Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.  “It is now a quarter to nine.”  “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully.  “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur—it may come in useful. Now for the details—the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?”  “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.”  “_Eh bien_?”  “Well, they started from Boulogne—but they never arrived.”  “What?”  “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.”  “And the bogus car?”  “Is still at large.”  Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?”  “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible—but nothing has been discovered!”  At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.  “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.”  The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew.  “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C——. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.”  “And they have found nothing else?”  “No.”  “Not the Prime Minister’s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it is strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive?”  Dodge shook his head. “One thing’s quite certain. They’re determined at all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.”  “If it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God grant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me everything—from the beginning. I must know about this shooting affair as well.”  “Last night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his secretaries, Captain Daniels——”  “The same who accompanied him to France?”  “Yes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.”  “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?”  Lord Estair smiled. “I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.”  “Has he any relatives in England?”  “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.”  “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?”  “That point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.”  “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?”  A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied:  “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced _anyone_ above suspicion.”  “_Très bien_. Now I understand, _milord_, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?”  Lord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.”  “O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?”  “Yes, he is an Irishman.”  “From what part of Ireland?”  “County Clare, I believe.”  “_Tiens!_ But proceed, _milord_.”  “The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road——”  “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot.  “Yes—but how did you know?”  “Oh, _c’est évident_! Continue!”  “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur——”  “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully.  “The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out—then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.”  “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver.  “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up—he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.”  “That is all you have to tell me?”  “Yes.”  “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?”  “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.”  “Yes?”  “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.”  “And the chauffeur?”  “The chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.”  “So,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the Prime Minister in France, and O’Murphy in London.”  He looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair.  “I can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that O’Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed in his face.”  “And to-day?”  “To-day I do not know what to think.”  Poirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again.  “I understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs—in every way, I mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.”  “Perfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour’s time, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard. You shall be accompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?”  “Quite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made you come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of yours.”  “We sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country.”  “_Comment?_ My old friend the _Préfet_——?”  Lord Estair shook his head.  “One higher than the _Préfet_. One whose word was once law in Belgium—and shall be again! That England has sworn!”  Poirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. “Amen to that! Ah, but my Master does not forget. . . . Messieurs, I, Hercule Poirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will be in time. But this is dark—dark. . . . I cannot see.”  “Well, Poirot,” I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the Ministers, “what do you think?”  My friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft movements. He shook his head thoughtfully.  “I do not know what to think. My brains desert me.”  “Why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do as well?” I mused.  “Pardon me, _mon ami_, but I did not quite say that. It is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.”  “But why?”  “Because uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the Prime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the situation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will the Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive? Nobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done. And, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what _les Boches_ are playing for. Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal paymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run no risk of the hangman’s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their affair.”  “Then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?”  Poirot made a gesture of anger. “Ah, that is just what I do not understand! It is inexplicable—stupid! They have all their arrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the abduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost impossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not twenty miles from London!”  “Perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other,” I suggested.  “Ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further—who is the traitor? There must have been a traitor—in the first affair, anyway. But who was it—Daniels or O’Murphy? It must have been one of the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot suppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination! Did O’Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels who told him to do so?”  “Surely it must have been O’Murphy’s doing.”  “Yes, because if it was Daniels’ the Prime Minister would have heard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are altogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each other. If O’Murphy is an honest man, _why_ did he leave the main road? But if he was a dishonest man, _why_ did he start the car again when only two shots had been fired—thereby, in all probability, saving the Prime Minister’s life? And, again, if he was honest, why did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a well-known rendezvous of German spies?”  “It looks bad,” I said.  “Let us look at the case with method. What have we for and against these two men? Take O’Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels. There is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages for a good Englishman! (Pardon me, _mon ami_, but, as linguists, you are deplorable!) _Now for him_, we have the fact that he was found gagged, bound, and chloroformed—which does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter.”  “He might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.”  Poirot shook his head. “The French police would make no mistake of that kind. Besides, once he had attained his object, and the Prime Minister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his remaining behind. His accomplices _could_ have gagged and chloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now, for, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have been cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.”  “Perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?”  “Then why did he not do so? He merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing more. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the truth.”  “Well,” I said, glancing at the clock, “I suppose we’d better start for the station. You may find more clues in France.”  “Possibly, _mon ami_, but I doubt it. It is still incredible to me that the Prime Minister has not been discovered in that limited area, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous. If the military and the police of two countries have not found him, how shall I?”  At Charing Cross we were met by Mr. Dodge.  “This is Detective Barnes, of Scotland Yard, and Major Norman. They will hold themselves entirely at your disposal. Good luck to you. It’s a bad business, but I’ve not given up hope. Must be off now.” And the Minister strode rapidly away.  We chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre of the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little ferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old acquaintance of Poirot’s—Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be one of the smartest of Scotland Yard’s officers. He came over and greeted my friend cheerfully.  “I heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far they’ve got away with the goods all right. But I can’t believe they can keep him hidden long. Our people are going through France with a toothcomb. So are the French. I can’t help feeling it’s only a matter of hours now.”  “That is, if he’s still alive,” remarked the tall detective gloomily.  Japp’s face fell. “Yes. . . . But somehow I’ve got the feeling he’s alive all right.”  Poirot nodded. “Yes, yes; he’s alive. But can he be found in time? I, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.”  The whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then, with a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station.  It was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together. Maps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages. Each man had his own pet theory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring in front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an amusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot’s behaviour moved me to intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat, clutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily.  “_Mon Dieu!_” he murmured. “This is terrible!”  “Have courage, Poirot,” I cried. “You will succeed. You will find him. I am sure of it.”  “Ah, _mon ami_, you mistake my emotion. It is this villainous sea that troubles me! The _mal de mer_—it is horrible suffering!”  “Oh!” I said, rather taken aback.  The first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and closed his eyes.  “Major Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to study it?”  Poirot shook his head impatiently.  “But no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the stomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the _mal de mer_. You breathe in—and out—slowly, so—turning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath.”  I left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.  As we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and smiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier’s system had succeeded “to a marvel!”  Japp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map. “Nonsense! The car started from Boulogne—here they branched off. Now, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another car. See?”  “Well,” said the tall detective, “I shall make for the seaports. Ten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.”  Japp shook his head. “Too obvious. The order went out at once to close all the ports.”  The day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot on the arm. “There’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.”  “Thank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to leave Boulogne.”  “What?”  “No, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.”  He suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a private room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending.  He shot a quick glance at us. “It is not so that the good detective should act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy. He must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must gather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea, is it not?”  His eyes challenged us. “But I—Hercule Poirot—tell you that it is not so! The true clues are within—_here_!” He tapped his forehead. “See you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the little grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part, until suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a spot—so—and I say: the Prime Minister is _there_! And it is so! With method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic rushing to France was a mistake—it is playing a child’s game of hide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to work the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of you.”  And for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking his eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously contemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness.  Finally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the window. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned for my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the daily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay alongside the quay.  Suddenly I was aroused by Poirot’s voice close to my elbow.  “_Mes amis_, let us start!”  I turned. An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend. His eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to the uttermost.  “I have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.”  Major Norman moved hastily to the door. “I’ll order the car.”  “There is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has fallen.”  “Do you mean you are going to walk, sir?”  “No, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea by boat.”  “To cross the _sea_?”  “Yes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And the beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return to England.”     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   At three o’clock, we stood once more upon Charing Cross platform. To all our expostulations, Poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time, but the only way. On the way over, he had conferred with Norman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from Dover.  Owing to the special passes held by Norman, we got through everywhere in record time. In London, a large police car was waiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend. He answered my inquiring glance.  “A list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of London. I wired for it from Dover.”  We were whirled rapidly through the London streets. We were on the Bath Road. On we went, through Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford. I began to see our objective. Through Windsor and on to Ascot. My heart gave a leap. Ascot was where Daniels had an aunt living. We were after _him_, then, not O’Murphy.  We duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. Poirot jumped out and rang the bell. I saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face. Plainly, he was not satisfied. The bell was answered. He was ushered inside. In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into the car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to die down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence incriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were holding the Prime Minister?  Our return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We deviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally stopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital. Poirot only spent a few minutes at each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored.  He whispered something to Norman, to which the latter replied:  “Yes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by the bridge.”  We turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a second car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men in plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we started off in a northerly direction, the other car following close behind.  We drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door of a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own grounds.  Norman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened it. The detective spoke.  “I am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.”  The girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of middle-age appeared behind her in the hall.  “Shut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.”  But Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same moment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and poured into the house, shutting the door behind them.  Norman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity. Finally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three prisoners—a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were taken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by Poirot himself.  “I must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this gentleman. You do not know him, no? _Eh bien_, let me present to you, Monsieur O’Murphy!”  O’Murphy! I _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again. He was not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He sat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman and I would be more than a match for him.  To my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not returning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the car slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon Aerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirot’s idea. He proposed to reach France by aeroplane.  It was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A telegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave the personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others.  As we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man took his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and then went off briskly.  I, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm.  “I congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place? But, look here, you must wire to France at once. You’ll be too late if you go yourself.”  Poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two.  “Unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram.”     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   At that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the Flying Corps.  “This is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France. He can start at once.”  “Wrap up warmly, sir,” said the young pilot. “I can lend you a coat, if you like.”  Poirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself: “Yes, there is time—just time.” Then he looked up, and bowed politely to the young officer. “I thank you, monsieur. But it is not I who am your passenger. It is this gentleman here.”  He moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out of the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of surprise.  _It was the Prime Minister!_     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   “For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?”  “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.”  “What?”  “I will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face——”  “But by whom?”  “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.”  “Impossible!”  “_Pas du tout!_ Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.”  “But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every one!”  “He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible—so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.”  “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?”  “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.”  “And the real Prime Minister?”  “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs. Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them—to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!”  I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.  “When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?”  “When I began to work the right way—from _within_! I could not make that shooting affair fit in—but when I saw that the net result of it was that _the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up_ I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure! After that, it was child’s-play for a mind like mine!”    •   •   •   •   •   •   •  The following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just received. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran:  “In time.”  Later in the day the evening papers published an account of the Allied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression.       IX     The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim   Poirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting his arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing, rather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The kettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot’s palate than what he described as “your English poison.” A sharp “rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered briskly.  “Hope I’m not late,” he said as he greeted us. “To tell the truth, I was yarning with Miller, the man who’s in charge of the Davenheim case.”  I pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp.  “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.”  Poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch, and said sharply:  “Be exact, my friend. What do you mean by ‘disappear’? To which class of disappearance are you referring?”  “Are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” I laughed.  Japp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both.  “But certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First, and most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much abused ‘loss of memory’ case—rare, but occasionally genuine. Third, murder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you refer to all three as impossible of execution?”  “Very nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory, but some one would be sure to recognize you—especially in the case of a well-known man like Davenheim. Then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to vanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in lonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the absconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off from foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched; and, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He’s up against civilization.”  “_Mon ami_,” said Poirot, “you make one error. You do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another man—or with himself in a figurative sense—might be that rare machine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a careful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force.”  “But not _you_, I suppose?” said Japp good-humouredly, winking at me. “He couldn’t baffle _you_, eh, Monsieur Poirot?”  Poirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest. “Me, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with an exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only too rare in the new generation of detectives!”  Japp grinned more widely.  “I don’t know,” he said. “Miller, the man who’s on this case, is a smart chap. You may be very sure he won’t overlook a footprint, or a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. He’s got eyes that see everything.”  “So, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, “has the London sparrow. But all the same, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of Mr. Davenheim.”  “Come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of details as clues?”  “By no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger is they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant; one or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells”—he tapped his forehead—“on which one must rely. The senses mislead. One must seek the truth within—not without.”  “You don’t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?”  “That is exactly what I do mean—granted the facts were placed before me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.”  Japp slapped his knee. “Hanged if I don’t take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand—or rather tell me where to lay my hand—on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.”  Poirot considered. “_Eh bien, mon ami_, I accept. _Le sport_, it is the passion of you English. Now—the facts.”  “On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After tea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added that he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come before he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door, passed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and—was never seen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.”  “Pretty—very pretty—altogether a charming little problem,” murmured Poirot. “Proceed, my good friend.”  “About a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick black moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he had an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen, and in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into the study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return. Finally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable to wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs. Davenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed unaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor. Mr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure.  “Well, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on Sunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make neither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office; nor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station they were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor had not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of the large reward offered for information, the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small race-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give any news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from all over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.  “On Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light. Behind a portière in Mr. Davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that safe had been broken into and rifled. The windows were fastened securely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having intervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is likely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained undetected until Monday.”  “_Précisément_,” said Poirot dryly. “Well, is he arrested, _ce pauvre M. Lowen_?”  Japp grinned. “Not yet. But he’s under pretty close supervision.”  Poirot nodded. “What was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?”  “We’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large transaction having been just carried through. There was also a small fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim’s jewels were kept in the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem.”  “Altogether a good haul,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Now, what about Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that evening?”  “Well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen is a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been able once or twice to score a _coup_ off Davenheim in the market, though it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter concerning some South American shares which led the banker to make his appointment.”  “Had Davenheim interests in South America, then?”  “I believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in Buenos Ayres.”  “Any trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good terms?”  “I should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful. Mrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a nonentity, I think.”  “Then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had he any enemies?”  “He had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular good-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him—and, if they had, where is the body?”  “Exactly. As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency.”  “By the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French window of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a good way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot fix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as the gardeners cease work at that time.”  “And Mr. Davenheim left the house?”  “About half-past five or thereabouts.”  “What lies beyond the rose-garden?”  “A lake.”  “With a boathouse?”  “Yes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you’re thinking of suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don’t mind telling you that Miller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged. That’s the kind of man he is!”  Poirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “Hastings, I pray you, hand me that copy of the _Daily Megaphone_. If I remember rightly, there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.”  I rose, and found the sheet required. Poirot studied the features attentively.  “H’m!” he murmured. “Wears his hair rather long and wavy, full moustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?”  “Yes.”  “Hair and beard turning grey?”  The detective nodded. “Well, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to say to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?”  “On the contrary, most obscure.”  The Scotland Yard man looked pleased.  “Which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished Poirot placidly.  “Eh?”  “I find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear as daylight—_eh bien_, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.”  Japp shook his head almost pityingly. “Well, each to their fancy. But it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.”  “I do not see,” murmured Poirot. “I shut my eyes—and think.”  Japp sighed. “Well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.”  “And you will bring me any fresh developments that arise—the result of the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller, for instance?”  “Certainly. That’s in the bargain.”  “Seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. “Like robbing a child!”  I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room.  “_Eh bien!_” said Poirot immediately. “You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?” He shook his finger at me. “You do not trust his grey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem—incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.”  “The lake!” I said significantly.  “And even more than the lake, the boathouse!”  I looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to question him further.  We heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he walked in about nine o’clock. I saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind.  “_Eh bien_, my friend,” remarked Poirot. “All goes well? But do not tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in your lake, because I shall not believe you.”  “We haven’t found the body, but we did find his _clothes_—the identical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to that?”  “Any other clothes missing from the house?”  “No, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his wardrobe is intact. There’s more. We’ve arrested Lowen. One of the maids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares that she saw Lowen coming _towards_ the study through the rose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten minutes before he left the house.”  “What does he himself say to that?”  “Denied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid was positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose. Rather a weak story! And there’s fresh evidence against him come to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well, that ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called Billy Kellett! He’s already known to the police—did three months last autumn for lifting an old gentleman’s watch. It seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded at the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted a policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street with Miller and saw him. He’s sober enough now, and I don’t mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting he might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer one it is.  “He was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins was his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a bad day, and was down on his luck. He was tramping along the road to Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village, ‘dark-complexioned gent, with a big moustache, one of them city toffs,’ is his description of the man.  “Kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just before he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down the road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge. Then he went on towards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight ‘chink’ which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short search, discovered the ring! That is Kellett’s story. It’s only fair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word of a man like Kellett can’t be relied upon in the slightest. It’s within the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him.”  Poirot shook his head.  “Very improbable, _mon ami_. He had no means of disposing of the body. It would have been found by now. Secondly, the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly, as he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of Lowen.”  Japp nodded. “I don’t say you’re not right. But all the same, you won’t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird’s evidence. What seems odd to me is that Lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring.”  Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Well, after all, if it were found in the neighbourhood, it might be argued that Davenheim himself had dropped it.”  “But why remove it from the body at all?” I cried.  “There might be a reason for that,” said Japp. “Do you know that just beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and not three minutes’ walk brings you to—what do you think?—a _lime kiln_.”  “Good heavens!” I cried. “You mean that the lime which destroyed the body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?”  “Exactly.”  “It seems to me,” I said, “that that explains everything. What a horrible crime!”  By common consent we both turned and looked at Poirot. He seemed lost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme mental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in doubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and turning to Japp, he asked:  “Have you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim occupied the same bedroom?”  The question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. “Good Lord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something startling. As to your question, I’m sure I don’t know.”  “You could find out?” asked Poirot with curious persistence.  “Oh, certainly—if you _really_ want to know.”  “_Merci, mon ami_. I should be obliged if you would make a point of it.”  Japp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have forgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and murmuring, “Poor old fellow! War’s been too much for him!” gently withdrew from the room.  As Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper, and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend’s voice aroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk and alert.  “_Que faites-vous là, mon ami?_”  “I was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of interest in this affair.”  “You become methodical—at last!” said Poirot approvingly.  I concealed my pleasure. “Shall I read them to you?”  “By all means.”  I cleared my throat.  “‘One: All the evidence points to Lowen having been the man who forced the safe.  “‘Two: He had a grudge against Davenheim.  “‘Three: He lied in his first statement that he had never left the study.  “‘Four: If you accept Billy Kellett’s story as true, Lowen is unmistakably implicated.’”  I paused. “Well?” I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on all the vital facts.  Poirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “_Mon pauvre ami!_ But it is that you have not the gift! The important detail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.”  “How?”  “Let me take your four points.  “One: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could not know beforehand that Mr. Davenheim would be absent posting a letter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!”  “He might have seized his opportunity,” I suggested.  “And the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s tools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with a penknife, _bien entendu_!”  “Well, what about Number Two?”  “You say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better of—it is more likely to be the other way about. Whatever grudge there might have been would have been on Mr. Davenheim’s side.”  “Well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the study?”  “No. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man’s clothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual, he would have done better to speak the truth.”  “And the fourth point?”  “I grant you that. If Kellett’s story is true, Lowen is undeniably implicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.”  “Then I did appreciate _one_ vital fact?”  “Perhaps—but you have entirely overlooked the two most important points, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter.”  “And pray, what are they?”  “One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last autumn.”  “Poirot, you are joking!”  “I am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not forget my little commission.”  But the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about eleven o’clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read it out:  “‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’”  “Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!”  I stared at him.  “You have no moneys in the bank of Davenheim and Salmon, _mon ami_?”  “No,” I said, wondering. “Why?”  “Because I should advise you to withdraw it—before it is too late.”  “Why, what do you expect?”  “I expect a big smash in a few days—perhaps sooner. Which reminds me, we will return the compliment of a _dépêche_ to Japp. A pencil, I pray you, and a form. _Voilà!_ ‘Advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question.’ That will intrigue him, the good Japp! His eyes will open wide—wide! He will not comprehend in the slightest—until to-morrow, or the next day!”  I remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friend’s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank.  Before we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and Japp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was Poirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of my friend.  “How did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?”  Poirot smiled placidly at him. “Ah, _mon ami_, after your wire, it was a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. Jewels, ready money, bearer bonds—all so conveniently arranged for—whom? Well, the good Monsieur Davenheim was of those who ‘look after Number One’ as your saying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged for—himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery! How simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put away in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track. His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with Mr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the house—where?” Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg. He frowned. “It is really insupportable,” he murmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! What symmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should sort them in dozens at the shop!”  “Never mind the eggs,” said Japp impatiently. “Let ’em lay ’em square if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he left The Cedars—that is, if you know!”  “_Eh bien_, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur Davenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but they are of the first quality!”  “Do you know where he is hiding?”  “Certainly! It is most ingenious.”  “For the Lord’s sake, tell us, then!”  Poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate, placed them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on top of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat effect, and then beamed affectionately on us both.  “Come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the question which I asked myself. ‘If I were this man, where should _I_ hide?’ Hastings, what do you say?”  “Well,” I said, “I’m rather inclined to think I’d not do a bolt at all. I’d stay in London—in the heart of things, travel by tubes and buses; ten to one I’d never be recognized. There’s safety in a crowd.”  Poirot turned inquiringly to Japp.  “I don’t agree. Get clear away at once—that’s the only chance. I would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I’d have a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I’d be off to one of the most out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry began!”  We both looked at Poirot. “What do _you_ say, monsieur?”  For a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted across his face.  “My friends, if _I_ were hiding from the police, do you know _where_ I should hide? _In a prison!_”  “_What?_”  “You are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison, so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there!”  “What do you mean?”  “You tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman. Nevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and confronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him! In spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. A woman nearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may be deceived!”  “Billy Kellett? But he’s known to the police!”  “Did I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his alibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn—he was creating the character of Billy Kellett, ‘doing three months,’ so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came. He was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty. It was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. Only——”  “Yes?”  “_Eh bien_, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had to _make up as himself_ again, and to sleep with a false beard is not easy—it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the last six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos Ayres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was sure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right. He went to the boathouse, donned his ‘tramp’ clothes, which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped the others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a policeman, getting himself safely into the haven of Bow Street, where nobody would ever dream of looking for him!”  “It’s impossible,” murmured Japp.  “Ask Madame,” said my friend, smiling.  The next day a registered letter lay beside Poirot’s plate. He opened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friend’s brow puckered.  “_Ah, sacré!_ But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse! _Ce pauvre Japp_! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we three! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I, who would not rob a child—_mille tonnerres! Mon ami_, what have you, that you laugh so heartily?”       X     The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman   Poirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near neighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. It was the genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer. The doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree, admired the talents so far removed from his own.  On one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. It must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room.  “Oh, doctor, you’re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a turn, it did indeed.”  I recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker’s housekeeper, Miss Rider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence.  “What terrible voice? Who is it, and what’s the trouble?”  “It was the telephone, doctor. I answered it—and a voice spoke. ‘Help,’ it said. ‘Doctor—help. They’ve killed me!’ Then it sort of tailed away. ‘Who’s speaking?’ I said. ‘Who’s speaking?’ Then I got a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘Foscatine’—something like that—‘Regent’s Court.’”  The doctor uttered an exclamation.  “Count Foscatini. He has a flat in Regent’s Court. I must go at once. What can have happened?”  “A patient of yours?” asked Poirot.  “I attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian, but he speaks English perfectly. Well, I must wish you good night, Monsieur Poirot, unless——” He hesitated.  “I perceive the thought in your mind,” said Poirot, smiling. “I shall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get hold of a taxi.”  Taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon bowling along in the direction of Regent’s Park. Regent’s Court was a new block of flats, situated just off St. John’s Wood Road. They had only recently been built, and contained the latest service devices.  There was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell impatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply.  “Flat II. Count Foscatini. There’s been an accident there, I understand.”  The man stared at him.  “First I’ve heard of it. Mr. Graves—that’s Count Foscatini’s man—went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.”  “Is the Count alone in the flat?”  “No, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.”  “What are they like?” I asked eagerly.  We were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on which Flat II was situated.  “I didn’t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were foreign gentlemen.”  He pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing. No. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell. There was no reply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang again and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no sign of life rewarded us.  “This is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. He turned to the lift attendant.  “Is there any pass-key to this door?”  “There is one in the porter’s office downstairs.”  “Get it, then, and, look here, I think you’d better send for the police.”  Poirot approved with a nod of the head.  The man returned shortly; with him came the manager.  “Will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?”  “Certainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying. You can understand that we must lose no time—if we are not already too late.”  The manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered the flat.  We passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the right of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod.  “The dining-room.”  Dr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we entered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though their occupants had just risen. In the corner, to the right of the fire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man—or what had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the telephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the base of it stained with blood.  The doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “Stone dead. Must have been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to telephone. It will be better not to move him until the police arrive.”  On the manager’s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result was a foregone conclusion. It was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out.  We came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in our tour. I found him studying the centre table with close attention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany table. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but the three dessert plates were untouched. There were three coffee-cups with remains of coffee in them—two black, one with milk. All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full, stood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar, the other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding cigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table.  I enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I wondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked him.  “_Mon ami_,” he replied, “you miss the point. I am looking for something that I do _not_ see.”  “What is that?”  “A mistake—even a little mistake—on the part of the murderer.”  He stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and shook his head.  “Monsieur,” he said to the manager, “explain to me, I pray, your system of serving meals here.”  The manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall.  “This is the service lift,” he explained. “It runs to the kitchens at the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and the dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic worries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant.”  Poirot nodded.  “Then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in the kitchen. You permit that I mount there?”  “Oh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you up and introduce you; but I’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s of any use. They’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and they’ll be all lumped together.”  Poirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II.  “The order was given from the _à la carte menu_—for three,” he explained. “Soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of beef, and a rice soufflé. What time? Just about eight o’clock, I should say. No, I’m afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now. Unfortunate. You were thinking of finger-prints, I suppose?”  “Not exactly,” said Poirot, with an enigmatical smile. “I am more interested in Count Foscatini’s appetite. Did he partake of every dish?”  “Yes; but of course I can’t say how much of each he ate. The plates were all soiled, and the dishes empty—that is to say, with the exception of the rice soufflé. There was a fair amount of that left.”  “Ah!” said Poirot, and seemed satisfied with the fact.  As we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone:  “We have decidedly to do with a man of method.”  “Do you mean the murderer, or Count Foscatini?”  “The latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. After imploring help and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up the telephone receiver.”  I stared at Poirot. His words now and his recent inquiries gave me the glimmering of an idea.  “You suspect poison?” I breathed. “The blow on the head was a blind.”  Poirot merely smiled.  We re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had arrived with two constables. He was inclined to resent our appearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland Yard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation.  This was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The story he had to tell was a sensational one.  On the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his master. They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of about forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four.  Count Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man paused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted that, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed immediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on.  The conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not as successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed, and that the basis of it was a threat. The discussion was anything but amicable. In the end, Count Foscatini raised his voice slightly, and the listener heard these words clearly:  “I have no time to argue further now, gentlemen. If you will dine with me to-morrow night at eight o’clock, we will resume the discussion.”  Afraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out to do his master’s errand. This evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent matters—politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When Graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off.  “Was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?” asked the inspector.  “No, sir; it wasn’t. That’s what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen.”  That finished Graves’s story. He had gone out about 8.30, and, meeting a friend, had accompanied him to the Metropolitan Music Hall in Edgware Road.  Nobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at 8.47. A small clock on the writing-table had been swept off by Foscatini’s arm, and had stopped at that hour, which agreed with Miss Rider’s telephone summons.  The police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it was now lying on the couch. I saw the face for the first time—the olive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth. Not altogether a pleasant face.  “Well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “The case seems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any chance?”  As Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.”  The inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us with a grin.  “Just in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. It’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these Italian vendetta things, as likely as not.”  Thus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was full of excitement.  “Like the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn’t believe it if you read about it.”  Poirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he had hardly opened his lips.  “What says the master detective, eh?” asked Hawker, clapping him on the back. “Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.”  “You think not?”  “What could there be?”  “Well, for example, there is the window.”  “The window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in that way. I noticed it specially.”  “And why were you able to notice it?”  The doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain.  “It is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd, that. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.”  “Well, what of it?”  “Very black,” repeated Poirot. “In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we get—what?”  “Moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “You’re pulling my leg.”  “Never do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.”  “I don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” I confessed. “You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they’ll test his alibi?”  “Without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.”  “You think he has an alibi?”  “That is just what worries me. I have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point.”  The _Daily Newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events.  Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count Foscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared entirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace the second man failed.  Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was discharged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one, and was being deliberately hushed up.  Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless, I was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that that visitor was none other than Ascanio himself.  “He wishes to consult you?”  “_Du tout_, Hastings. I wish to consult him.”  “What about?”  “The Regent’s Court murder.”  “You are going to prove that he did it?”  “A man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to have the common sense. Ah, that is our friend’s ring.”  A few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered in—a small, thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained standing, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us.  “Monsieur Poirot?”  My little friend tapped himself gently on the chest.  “Be seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid me. Let us commence. You—in company with a friend—visited the late Count Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th——”  The Italian made an angry gesture.  “I did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court——”  “_Précisément_—and I have a little idea that you have sworn falsely.”  “You threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been acquitted.”  “Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows I threaten you—but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do not like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little ideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your only chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came for the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.”  “He was not a count,” growled the Italian.  “I have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the _Almanach de Gotha_. Never mind, the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing.”  “I suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.”  “I have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor Ascanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning—that is so, is it not?”  “Yes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was no need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man of great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel’s possession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon him by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of the Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had hoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge one.”  “Pardon, how was it paid?”  “In Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over the money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers. I never saw him again.”  “Why did you not say all this when you were arrested?”  “In my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with the man.”  “And how do you account for the events of the evening, then?”  “I can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me. I understand that no money was found in the flat.”  Poirot looked at him and shook his head.  “Strange,” he murmured. “We all have the little grey cells. And so few of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I believe your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had to make sure.”  After bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and smiled at me.  “Let us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?”  “Well, I suppose Ascanio is right—somebody impersonated him.”  “Never, never will you use the brains the good God has given you. Recall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that night. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are in the month of June. It is still light at eight o’clock. The light is failing by half-past. _Ça vous dit quelque chose?_ I perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us continue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini’s teeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason from that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there was coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count Foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?”  I shook my head, utterly bewildered.  “Come, I will help you. What evidence have we that Ascanio and his friend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that night? Nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. We have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.”  “You mean?”  “I mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. Ah, but it was a clever idea! Graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a man of method! He overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning, enough to realize that Ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself. The following evening, about eight o’clock, he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone. Foscatini sits down, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind Graves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to the service telephone—dinner for three! It comes, he lays the table, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to get rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a resolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos, the rice soufflé is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion. Ah, but it was magnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the clock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as possible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry. So successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from Flat II at that time.”  “Except Hercule Poirot, I suppose?” I said sarcastically.  “Not even Hercule Poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “I am about to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But you will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have already given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable Graves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.”  Poirot _was_ right. He always is, confound him!       XI     The Case of the Missing Will   The problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received a brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an appointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the following day.  She arrived punctually—a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but neatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her good looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour.  “My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,” she began, after she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story.”  “If you please, mademoiselle.”  “I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small yeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder brother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well indeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no leanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm. He married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from Australia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native county. He was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was his own daughter.  “Crabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as to the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no education, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little value on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ He was especially opposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home, and have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and annoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much attached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky enough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these ‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing from him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply attached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted on that note. ‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no book learning, but, for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day. We’ll see what we shall see.’  “That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end occasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health had been failing, and a month ago he died.  “I am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most extraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his death—‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various charitable institutions.”  “That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.”  “I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.”  “Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?”  “No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.”  “There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?”  “I would not even attempt to do such a thing.”  “You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle?”  “That is exactly how I look upon it.”  “It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “Somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.”  “Exactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.”  “Eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at your disposal. You have made no search yourself?”  “Only a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle’s undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.”  “Have you the will or a copy of it with you?”  Miss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it, nodding to himself.  “Made three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given also—11 a.m.—that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of search. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made even half-an-hour later would upset this. _Eh bien_, mademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!”  (Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!)  “Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?”  “Yes, their name is Baker.”     •   •   •   •   •   •   •   The following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had arrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant couple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin, and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm.  Tired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken, apple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s constant resting-place. A big chintz-covered settee ran along the opposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.  “_Eh bien, mon ami_,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny cigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not expect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place. But first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray of you.”  I did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked up and down, looking about him approvingly.  “A man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory label—so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see with what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the heart. Nothing here offends the eye——”  He came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words: “Key of Roll Top Desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys.  “An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here we have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is also a young lady of method and order.”  Baker came in answer to the bell.  “Will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?”  Baker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker, wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.  In a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The Bakers were immediately sympathetic.  “Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared the woman. “Cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.”  Poirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms.  “Two?” said Poirot sharply.  “Yes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil one—and sure enough, so he did do. Us had signed one——”  “What time of day was that?”  Baker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.  “Why, to be sure, I’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven. Don’t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen.”  “And afterwards?”  “’Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. ‘I’ve made a mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. I’ll trouble you to sign again,’ and us did. And afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each. ‘I’ve left you nothing in my will,’ says he, ‘but each year I live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg when I’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.”  Poirot reflected.  “After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do you know?”  “Went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.”  That did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He held out the key of the desk.  “Is that your master’s writing?”  I may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed before Baker replied: “Yes, sir, it is.”  “He’s lying,” I thought. “But why?”  “Has your master let the house?—have there been any strangers in it during the last three years?”  “No, sir.”  “No visitors?”  “Only Miss Violet.”  “No strangers of any kind been inside this room?”  “No, sir.”  “You forget the workmen, Jim,” his wife reminded him.  “Workmen?” Poirot wheeled round on her. “What workmen?”  The woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague as to what the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her master’s and quite unnecessary. Part of the time the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done there she could not say, as her master had not let either of them into the room whilst the work was in progress. Unfortunately, they could not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact that it was a Plymouth one.  “We progress, Hastings,” said Poirot, rubbing his hands as the Bakers left the room. “Clearly he made a second will and then had workmen from Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead of wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will go to Plymouth.”  With a little trouble, we were able to get the information we wanted. After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh.  Their employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh’s orders. They remembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs, they had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled moustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow.  We returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the study door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed.  Eagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty.  “_Sacré!_” cried Poirot angrily. “Some one has been before us.”  We examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment of what we sought. A portion of Baker’s signature remained, but no indication of what the terms of the will had been.  Poirot sat back on his heels. His expression would have been comical if we had not been so overcome.  “I understand it not,” he growled. “Who destroyed this? And what was their object?”  “The Bakers?” I suggested.  “_Pourquoi?_ Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s advantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit—yes; but one cannot suspect institutions.”  “Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,” I suggested.  Poirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.  “That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations, Hastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against the late Andrew Marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better off for our success.”  By driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner. Suddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a piercing squeal.  “_Vite_, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!”  Before I knew where I was we were standing on the platform, bareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into the night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.  “Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again will I vaunt my little grey cells!”  “That’s a good job at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this all about?”  As usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely no attention to me.  “The tradesmen’s books—I have left them entirely out of account! Yes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at once.”  Easier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter, and there Poirot hired a car. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention to anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study.  “I have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my friend,” he deigned to remark. “Now, behold!”  Going straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the envelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly hope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care he cut open the envelope, laying it out flat. Then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear.  “Look, _mon ami_!” cried Poirot in triumph.  I looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was dated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike, confectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman.  “But is it legal?” I gasped.  “As far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the testator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation. But the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher would take—that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms, makes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen containing his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be thoroughly welcome to his money.”  “She didn’t see through it, did she?” I said slowly. “It seems rather unfair. The old man really won.”  “But no, Hastings. It is _your_ wits that go astray. Miss Marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands. Always employ the expert. She has amply proved her right to the money.”  I wonder—I very much wonder—what old Andrew Marsh would have thought!     THE END ",

        "content": "CAUGHT IN THE NET     CHAPTER I.  PUTTING ON THE SCREW.  The cold on the 8th of February, 186-, was more intense than the Parisians had experienced during the whole of the severe winter which had preceded it, for at twelve o'clock on that day Chevalier's thermometer, so well known by the denizens of Paris, registered three degrees below zero. The sky was overcast and full of threatening signs of snow, while the moisture on the pavement and roads had frozen hard, rendering traffic of all kinds exceedingly hazardous. The whole great city wore an air of dreariness and desolation, for even when a thin crust of ice covers the waters of the Seine, the mind involuntarily turns to those who have neither food, shelter, nor fuel.  This bitterly cold day actually made the landlady of the Hotel de Perou, though she was a hard, grasping woman of Auvergne, give a thought to the condition of her lodgers, and one quite different from her usual idea of obtaining the maximum of rent for the minimum of accommodation.  \"The cold,\" remarked she to her husband, who was busily engaged in replenishing the stove with fuel, \"is enough to frighten the wits out of a Polar bear. In this kind of weather I always feel very anxious, for it was during a winter like this that one of our lodgers hung himself, a trick which cost us fifty francs, in good, honest money, besides giving us a bad name in the neighborhood. The fact is, one never knows what lodgers are capable of doing. You should go up to the top floor, and see how they are getting on there.\"  \"Pooh, pooh!\" replied her husband, M. Loupins; \"they will do well enough.\"  \"Is that really your opinion?\"  \"I know that I am right. Daddy Tantaine went out as soon as it was light, and a short time afterward Paul Violaine came down. There is no one upstairs now but little Rose, and I expect that she has been wise enough to stick to her bed.\"  \"Ah!\" answered the landlady rather spitefully. \"I have made up my mind regarding that young lady some time ago; she is a sight too pretty for this house, and so I tell you.\"  The Hotel de Perou stands in the Rue de la Hachette, not twenty steps from the Place de Petit Pont; and no more cruelly sarcastic title could ever have been conferred on a building. The extreme shabbiness of the exterior of the house, the narrow, muddy street in which it stood, the dingy windows covered with mud, and repaired with every variety of patch,--all seemed to cry out to the passers by: \"This is the chosen abode of misery and destitution.\"  The observer might have fancied it a robbers' den, but he would have been wrong; for the inhabitants were fairly honest. The Hotel de Perou was one of those refuges, growing scarcer and more scarce every day, where unhappy men and women, who had been worsted in the battle of life, could find a shelter in return for the change remaining from the last five-franc piece. They treat it as the shipwrecked mariner uses the rock upon which he climbs from the whirl of the angry waters, and breathes a deep sigh of relief as he collects his forces for a fresh effort. However wretched existence may be, a protracted sojourn in such a shelter as the Hotel de Perou would be out of the question. The chambers in every floor of the house are divided into small slips by partitions, covered with canvas and paper, and pleasantly termed rooms by M. Loupins. The partitions were in a terrible condition, rickety and unstable, and the paper with which they were covered torn and hanging down in tatters; but the state of the attics was even more deplorable, the ceilings of which were so low that the occupants had to stoop continually, while the dormer windows admitted but a small amount of light. A bedstead, with a straw mattress, a rickety table, and two broken chairs, formed the sole furniture of these rooms. Miserable as these dormitories were, the landlady asked and obtained twenty-two francs for them by the month, as there was a fireplace in each, which she always pointed out to intending tenants.  The young woman whom M. Loupins alluded to by the name of Rose was seated in one of these dreary dens on this bitter winter's day. Rose was an exquisitely beautiful girl about eighteen years of age. She was very fair; her long lashes partially concealed a pair of steely blue eyes, and to a certain extent relieved their hard expression. Her ripe, red lips, which seemed formed for love and kisses, permitted a glimpse of a row of pearly teeth. Her bright waving hair grew low down upon her forehead, and such of it as had escaped from the bondage of a cheap comb, with which it was fastened, hung in wild luxuriance over her exquisitely shaped neck and shoulders. She had thrown over her ragged print gown the patched coverlet of the bed, and, crouched upon the tattered hearthrug before the hearth, upon which a few sticks smouldered, giving out hardly a particle of heat, she was telling her fortune with a dirty pack of cards, endeavoring to console herself for the privations of the day by the promise of future prosperity. She had spread those arbiters of her destiny in a half circle before her, and divided them into threes, each of which had a peculiar meaning, and her breast rose and fell as she turned them up and read upon their faces good fortune or ill-luck. Absorbed in this task, she paid but little attention to the icy chilliness of the atmosphere, which made her fingers stiff, and dyed her white hands purple.  \"One, two, three,\" she murmured in a low voice. \"A fair man, that's sure to be Paul. One, two, three, money to the house. One, two, three, troubles and vexations. One, two, three, the nine of spades; ah, dear! more hardships and misery,--always that wretched card turning up with its sad story!\"  Rose seemed utterly downcast at the sight of the little piece of painted cardboard, as though she had received certain intelligence of a coming misfortune. She soon, however, recovered herself, and was again shuffling the pack,--cut it, taking care to do so with her left hand, spread them out before her, and again commenced counting: one, two, three. This time the cards appeared to be more propitious, and held out promises of success for the future.  \"I am loved,\" read she, as she gazed anxiously upon them,--\"very much loved! Here is rejoicing, and a letter from a dark man! See, here he is,--the knave of clubs. Always the same,\" she continued; \"I cannot strive against fate.\"  Then, rising to her feet, she drew from a crack in the wall, which formed a safe hiding-place for her secrets, a soiled and crumpled letter, and, unfolding it, she read for perhaps the hundredth time these words:--  \"MADEMOISELLE,--  \"To see you is to love you. I give you my word of honor that this is true. The wretched hovel where your charms are hidden is no fit abode for you. A home, worthy in every way to receive you, is at your service--Rue de Douai. It has been taken in your name, as I am straightforward in these matters. Think of my proposal, and make what inquiries you like concerning me. I have not yet attained my majority, but shall do so in five months and three days, when I shall inherit my mother's fortune. My father is wealthy, but old and infirm. From four to six in the afternoon of the next few days I will be in a carriage at the corner of the Place de Petit Pont.  \"GASTON DE GANDELU.\"   The cynical insolence of the letter, together with its entire want of form, was a perfect example of the style affected by those loiterers about town, known to the Parisians as \"mashers;\" and yet Rose did not appear at all disgusted by the reception of such an unworthily worded proposal, but, on the contrary, rather pleased by its contents. \"If I only dared,\" mused she, with a sigh,--\"ah, if I only dared!\" For a time she sat deeply immersed in thought, with her face buried in her hands, until she was aroused from her meditations by the sound of an active and youthful step upon the creaking stairs. \"He has come back,\" she gasped; and with the agile movement of a cat she again concealed the letter in its hiding-place, and she had scarcely done so, when Paul Violaine entered the miserable room. He was a young man of twenty-three, of slender figure, but admirably proportioned. His face was a perfect oval, and his complexion of just that slight olive tint which betrays the native of the south of France. A slight, silky moustache concealed his upper lip, and gave his features that air of manliness in which they would have otherwise been deficient. His curly chestnut hair fell gracefully over a brow upon which an expression of pride was visible, and enhanced the peculiar, restless glance of his large dark eyes. His physical beauty, which was fully equal to that of Rose, was increased by an aristocratic air, popularly believed to be only found in the scions of noble families. The landlady, in her moments of good humor, used to assert her belief that her lodger was a disguised prince; but if this were the case, he was certainly one that had been overtaken by poverty. His dress, to which the closest attention had been paid, revealed the state of destitution in which he was,--not the destitution which openly asks for alms, but the hidden poverty which shuns communication and blushes at a single glance of pity. In this almost Arctic winter he wore clothes rendered thin by the constant friction of the clothes brush, over which was a light overcoat about as thick as the web of a spider. His shoes were well blacked, but their condition told the piteous tale of long walks in search of employment, or of that good luck which seems to evade its pursuer.  Paul was holding a roll of manuscript in his hand, and as he entered the room he threw it on the bed with a despairing gesture. \"A failure again!\" exclaimed he, in accents of the utmost depression. \"Nothing else but failures!\"  The young woman rose hastily to her feet; she appeared to have forgotten the cards completely; the smile of satisfaction faded from her face and her features, and an expression of utter weariness took its place.  \"What! no success?\" she cried, affecting a surprise which was evidently assumed. \"No success, after all your promises when you left me this morning?\"  \"This morning, Rose, a ray of hope had penetrated my heart; but I have been deceived, or rather I deceived myself, and I took my ardent desires for so many promises which were certain to be fulfilled. The people that I have been to have not even the kindness to say 'No' plain and flat; they listen to all you have to say, and as soon as your back is turned they forget your existence. The coin that passes around in this infernal town is indeed nothing but idle words, and that is all that poverty-stricken talent can expect.\"  A silence of some duration ensued, and Paul was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice the look of contempt with which Rose was regarding him. His helpless resignation to adverse circumstances appeared to have turned her to stone.  \"A nice position we are in!\" said she at last. \"What do you think will become of us?\"  \"Alas! I do not know.\"  \"Nor I. Yesterday Madame Loupins came to me and asked for the eleven francs we owe here; and told me plainly that if within three days we did not settle our account, she would turn us out; and I know enough of her to be sure that she will keep her word. The detestable old hag would do anything for the pleasure of seeing me on the streets.\"  \"Alone and friendless in the world,\" muttered Paul, paying but little attention to the young girl's words, \"without a creature or a relative to care for you, or to lend you a helping hand.\"  \"We have not a copper in the world,\" continued Rose with cruel persistency; \"I have sold everything that I had, to preserve the rags that I am wearing. Not a scrap of wood remains, and we have not tasted food since yesterday morning.\"  To these words, which were uttered in a tone of the most bitter reproach, the young man made no reply, but clasped his icily cold hands against his forehead, as though in utter despair.  \"Yes, that is a true picture of our position,\" resumed Rose coldly, her accents growing more and more contemptuous. \"And I tell you that something must be done at once, some means discovered, I care not what, to relieve us from our present miserable state.\"  Paul tore off his overcoat, and held it toward her.  \"Take it, and pawn it,\" exclaimed he; but the girl made no move.  \"Is that all that you have to propose?\" asked she, in the same glacial tone.  \"They will lend you three francs upon it, and with that we can get bread and fuel.\"  \"And after that is gone?\"  \"After that--oh, we will think of our next step, and shall have time to hit upon some plan. Time, a little time, is all that I require, Rose, to break asunder the bonds which seem to fetter me. Some day success must crown my efforts; and with success, Rose, dear, will come affluence, but in the meantime we must learn to wait.\"  \"And where are the means to enable us to wait?\"  \"No matter; they will come. Only do what I tell you, and who can say what to-morrow----\"  Paul was still too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice the expression upon the young girl's face; for had he done so, he would at once have perceived that she was not in the humor to permit the matter to be shelved in this manner.  \"To-morrow!\" she broke in sarcastically. \"To-morrow,--always the same pitiful cry. For months past we seem to have lived upon the word. Look you here, Paul, you are no longer a child, and ought to be able to look things straight in the face. What can I get on that threadbare coat of yours? Perhaps three francs at the outside. How many days will that last us? We will say three. And then, what then? Besides, can you not understand that your dress is too shabby for you to make an impression on the people you go to see? Well-dressed applicants only have attention, and to obtain money, you must appear not to need it; and, pray, what will people think of you if you have no overcoat? Without one you will look ridiculous, and can hardly venture into the streets.\"  \"Hush!\" cried Paul, \"for pity's sake, hush! for your words only prove to me more plainly that you are like the rest of the world, and that want of success is a pernicious crime in your eyes. You once had confidence in me, and then you spoke in a very different strain.\"  \"Once indeed! but then I did not know--\"  \"No, Rose, it was not what you were then ignorant of; but it was that in those days you loved me.  \"Great heavens! I ask you, have I left one stone unturned? Have I not gone from publisher to publisher to sell those songs of my own composing--those songs that you sing so well? I have endeavored to get pupils. What fresh efforts can I try? What would _you_ do, were you in my place? Tell me, I beg you.\"  And as Paul spoke, he grew more and more excited, while Rose still maintained her manner of exasperating coolness.  \"I know not,\" she replied, after a brief pause; \"but if I were a man, I do not think I would permit the woman, for whom I pretended that I had the most sincere affection, to be in want of the actual necessities of life. I would strain every effort to obtain them.\"  \"I have no trade; I am no mechanic,\" broke in Paul passionately.  \"Then I would learn one. Pray how much does a man earn who climbs the ladder with a bricklayer's hod upon his shoulders? It may be hard work, I know, but surely the business is not difficult to learn. You have, or say you have, great musical talents. I say nothing about them; but had I any vocal powers and if there was not a morsel to eat in the house, I would go and sing in the taverns or even in the public streets, and would earn money, and care little for the means by which I made it.\"  \"When you say those things, you seem to forget that I am an honest man.\"  \"One would really suppose that I had suggested some questionable act to you. Your reply, Paul, plainly proves to me that you are one of those who, for want of determination, fall, helpless, by the wayside in the journey of life. They flaunt their rags and tatters in the eyes of the world, and with saddened hearts and empty stomachs utter the boast, 'I am an honest man.' Do you think that, in order to be rich, you must perforce be a rogue? This is simple imbecility.\"  She uttered this tirade in clear and vibrant accents, and her eyes gleamed with the fire of savage resolution. Her nature was one of those cruel and energetic ones, which lead a woman to hurl a man from the brink of the abyss to which she had conducted him, and to forget him before he has ever reached the bottom.  This torrent of sarcasm brought out Paul's real nature. His face flushed, and rage began to gain the mastery over him. \"Can you not work?\" he asked. \"Why do you not do something instead of talking so much?\"  \"That is not at all the same thing,\" answered she coolly. \"I was not made for work.\"  Paul made a threatening gesture. \"You wretch!\" exclaimed he.  \"You are wrong,\" she replied. \"I am not a wretch; I am simply hungry.\"  There seemed every prospect of an angry scene, when a slight sound attracted the attention of the disputants, and, turning round, they saw an old man standing upon the threshold of their open door. He was tall, but stooped a good deal. He had high, thick brows, and a red nose; a long, thick, grizzly beard covered the rest of his countenance. He wore a pair of spectacles with colored glasses, which, to a great extent, concealed the expression of his face. His whole attire indicated extreme poverty. He wore a greasy coat, much frayed and torn at the pockets, and which had carried away with it marks of all the walls against which it had been rubbed when he had indulged a little too freely in the cheerful glass. He seemed to belong to that class who consider it a work of supererogation to disrobe before going to bed, and who just turn in on such spot as the fancy of the moment may dictate. Paul and Rose both recognized the old man from having continually met him when ascending or descending the staircase, and knew that he rented the back attic, and was called Daddy Tantaine. In an instant the idea flashed across Paul's mind that the dilapidated state of the partition permitted every word spoken in one attic to be overheard in the other, and this did not tend to soothe his exasperated feelings.  \"What do you want here, sir?\" asked he angrily. \"And, pray, who gave you permission to enter my room without leave?\"  The old man did not seem at all put out by the threatening language of his questioner. \"I should be telling a fib,\" answered he calmly, \"if I were to tell you that, being in my own room and hearing you quarrelling, I did not hear every word of what you have been saying.\"  \"Sir!\"  \"Stop a bit, and don't be in such a hurry, my young friend. You seem disposed to quarrel, and, on my faith, I am not surprised; for when there is no corn in the manger, the best tempered horse will bite and kick.\"  He uttered these words in the most soothing accents, and appeared utterly unconscious of having committed any breach of etiquette in entering the room.  \"Well, sir,\" said Paul, a flush of shame passing across his face, \"you see now how poverty can drag a man down. Are you satisfied?\"  \"Come, come, my young friend,\" answered Daddy Tantaine, \"you should not get angry; and if I did step in without any notice, it was because, as a neighbor, I find I might venture on such a liberty; for when I heard how embarrassed you were, I said to myself, 'Tantaine, perhaps you can help this pretty pair out of the scrape they have got into.'\"  The promise of assistance from a person who had not certainly the outward appearance of a capitalist seemed so ludicrous to Rose that she could not restrain a smile, for she fancied that if their old neighbor was to present them with half his fortune, it might possibly amount to twenty centimes or thereabouts.  Paul had formed a somewhat similar idea, but he was a little touched by this act of friendliness on the part of a man who doubtless knew that money lent under similar circumstances was but seldom returned.  \"Ah, sir!\" said he, and this time he spoke in softer accents, \"what can you possibly do for us?\"  \"Who can say?\"  \"You can see how hard we are pushed. We are in want of almost everything. Have we not reached the _acme_ of misery?\"  The old man raised his hand to heaven, as if to seek for aid from above.  \"You have indeed come to a terrible pass,\" murmured he; \"but all is not yet lost. The pearl which lies in the depths of the ocean is not lost for ever; for may not some skillful diver bring it to the surface? A fisherman may not be able to do much with it, but he knows something of its value, and hands it over to the dealer in precious stones.\"  He intensified his speech by a little significant laugh, the meaning of which was lost upon the two young people who, though their evil instincts led them to be greedy and covetous, were yet unskilled in the world's ways.  \"I should,\" remarked Paul, \"be a fool if I did not accept the offer of your kind assistance.\"  \"There, then, that is right; and now the first thing to do is to have a really good feed. You must get in some wood too, for it is frightfully cold. My old bones are half frozen; and afterward we will talk of a fresh rig out for you both.\"  \"Yes,\" remarked Rose with a faint sigh; \"but to do all that, we want a lot of money.\"  \"Well, how do you know that I can't find it?\"  Daddy Tantaine unbuttoned his great coat with grave deliberation, and drew from an inner pocket a small scrap of paper which had been fastened to the lining by a pin. This he unfolded with the greatest of care and laid upon the table.  \"A banknote for five hundred francs!\" exclaimed Rose, with extreme surprise. Paul did not utter a word. Had he seen the woodwork of the chair upon which he was leaning burst into flower and leaf, he could not have looked more surprised. Who could have expected to find such a sum concealed beneath the old man's tatters, and how could he have obtained so much money? The idea that some robbery had been committed at once occurred to both the young people, and they exchanged a meaning glance, which, however, did not escape the observation of their visitor.  \"Pooh, pooh!\" said he, without appearing in the slightest degree annoyed. \"You must not give way to evil thoughts or suspicions. It is a fact that banknotes for five hundred francs don't often grow out of a ragged pocket like mine. But I got this fellow honestly,--that I can guarantee.\"  Rose paid no attention to his words; indeed, she took no interest in them. The note was there, and that was enough for her. She took it up and smoothed it out as though the crisp paper communicated a pleasant sensation to her fingers.  \"I must tell you,\" resumed Daddy Tantaine, \"that I am employed by a sheriff's officer, and that, in addition, I do a little bill collecting for various persons. By these means I have often comparatively large sums in my possession, and I can lend you five hundred francs for a short time without any inconvenience to myself.\"  Paul's necessities and conscience were fighting a hard battle, and he remained silent, as a person generally does before arriving at a momentous decision.  At length he broke the silence. \"No,\" said he, \"your offer is one that I cannot accept, for I feel--\"  \"This is no time, my dear Paul, to talk of feelings,\" interrupted Rose; \"besides, can you not see that our refusal to accept the loan annoys this worthy gentleman?\"  \"The young lady is quite right,\" returned Daddy Tantaine. \"Come, let us say that the matter is settled. Go out and get in something to eat, sharp, for it has struck four some time ago.\"  At these words, Rose started, and a scarlet flush spread over her cheek. \"Four o'clock,\" repeated she, thinking of her letter; but after a moment's reflection she stepped up to the cracked mirror, and arranging her tattered skirts, took up the banknote and left the room.  \"She is a rare beauty,\" remarked Daddy Tantaine with the air of one who was an authority in such matters, \"and as clever as they make them. Ah! if she had only some one to give her a hint, she might rise to any height.\"  Paul's ideas were in such a wild state of confusion, that he could make no reply; and, now that he was no longer held in thrall by Rose's presence, he began to be terrified at what had taken place, for he imagined that he caught a sinister expression in the old man's face which made him very suspicious of the wisdom of the course he had been persuaded to pursue. Was there ever such an unheard-of event as an old man of such a poverty-stricken appearance showering banknotes upon the heads of perfect strangers? There was certainly something mysterious in the affair, and Paul made up his mind that he would do his utmost to avoid being compromised.  \"I have thought the matter over,\" said he resolutely; \"and it is impossible for me to accept the loan of a sum which it would be difficult for me to repay.\"  \"My dear young friend, that is not the way to talk. If you do not have a good opinion of yourself, all the world will judge you according to your own estimation. Your inexperience has, up to this time, been the sole cause of your failure. Poverty soon changes a boy into a man as straw ripens fruit; but the first thing you must do is to put all confidence in me. You can repay the five hundred francs at your convenience, but I must have six per cent. for my money and your note of hand.\"  \"But really--,\" began Paul.  \"I am looking at the matter in a purely business light, so we can drop sentiment.\"  Paul had so little experience in the ways of the world, that the mere fact of giving his acceptance for the money borrowed put him at once at his ease, though he knew well that his name was not a very valuable addition to the slip of paper.  Daddy Tantaine, after a short search through his pockets, discovered a bill stamp, and, placing it on the table, said, \"Write as I shall dictate:--  'On the 8th of June, 188-, I promise to pay to M. Tantaine or order the sum of five hundred francs for value received, such sum to bear interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum.  'Frs. 500.  'PAUL VIOLAINE.'\"   The young man had just completed his signature when Rose made her appearance, bearing a plentiful stock of provisions in her arms. Her eyes had a strange radiance in them, which Paul, however, did not notice, as he was engaged in watching the old man, who, after carefully inspecting the document, secured it in one of the pockets of his ragged coat.  \"You will, of course, understand, sir,\" remarked Paul, \"that there is not much chance of my being able to save sufficient to meet this bill in four months, so that the date is a mere form.\"  A smile of benevolence passed over Daddy Tantaine's features. \"And suppose,\" said he, \"that I, the lender, was to put the borrower in a position to repay the advance before a month had passed?\"  \"Ah! but that is not possible.\"  \"I do not say, my young friend, that I could do this myself; but I have a good friend whose hand reaches a long way. If I had only listened to his advice when I was younger, you would not have caught me to-day in the Hotel de Perou. Shall I introduce you to him?\"  \"Am I a perfect fool, to throw away such a chance?\"  \"Good! I shall see him this evening, and will mention your name to him. Call on him at noon to-morrow, and if he takes a fancy to you,--decides to push you, your future is assured, and you will have no doubts as to getting on.\"  He took out a card from his pocket and handed it to Paul, adding, \"The name of my friend is Mascarin.\"  Meanwhile Rose, with a true Parisian's handiness, had contrived to restore order from chaos, and had arranged the table, with its one or two pieces of broken crockery, with scraps of brown paper instead of plates. A fresh supply of wood crackled bravely on the hearth, and two candles, one of which was placed in a chipped bottle, and the other in a tarnished candlestick belonging to the porter of the hotel. In the eyes of both the young people the spectacle was a truly delightful one, and Paul's heart swelled with triumph. The business had been satisfactorily concluded, and all his misgivings were at an end.  \"Come, let us gather round the festive board,\" said he joyously. \"This is breakfast and dinner in one. Rose, be seated; and you, my dear friend, will surely share with us the repast we owe to you?\"  With many protestations of regret, however, Daddy Tantaine pleaded an important engagement at the other end of Paris. \"And,\" added he, \"it is absolutely necessary that I should see Mascarin this evening, for I must try my best to make him look on you with a favorable eye.\"  Rose was very glad when the old man took his departure, for his ugliness, the shabbiness of his dress, and his general aspect of dirt, drove away all the feelings of gratitude she ought to have evinced, and inspired in her loathing and repugnance; and she fancied that his eyes, though veiled by his colored glasses, could detect the minutest secrets of her heart; but still this did not prevent her putting on a sweet smile and entreating him to remain.  But Daddy Tantaine was resolute; and after impressing upon Paul the necessity of punctuality, he went away, repeating, as he passed through the door, \"May good appetite be present at your little feast, my dears.\"  As soon, however, as the door was closed he bent down and listened. The young people were as merry as larks, and their laughter filled the bare attic of the Hotel de Perou. Why should not Paul have been in good spirits? He had in his pocket the address of the man who was to make his fortune, and on the chimney-piece was the balance of the banknote, which seemed to him an inexhaustible sum. Rose, too, was delighted, and could not refrain from jeering at their benefactor, whom she stigmatized as \"an old idiot.\"  \"Laugh while you can, my dears!\" muttered Daddy Tantaine; \"for this may be the last time you will do so.\"  With these words he crept down the dark staircase, which was only lighted up on Sundays, owing to the high price of gas, and, peeping through the glass door of the porter's lodge, saw Madame Loupins engaged in cooking; and, with the timid knock of a man who has learned his lesson in poverty's grammar, he entered.  \"Here is my rent, madame,\" said he, placing on the table ten francs and twenty centimes. Then, as the woman was scribbling a receipt, he launched into a statement of his own affairs, and told her that he had come into a little property which would enable him to live in comfort during his few remaining years on earth; and--evidently fearing that his well-known poverty might cause Madame Loupins to discredit his assertions--drew out his pocketbook and exhibited several banknotes. This exhibition of wealth so surprised the landlady, that when the old man left she insisted on lighting him to the door. He turned eastward as soon as he had left the house, and, glancing at the names of the shops, entered a grocer's establishment at the corner of the Rue de Petit Pont. This grocer, thanks to a certain cheap wine, manufactured for him by a chemist at Bercy, had achieved a certain notoriety in that quarter. He was very stout and pompous, a widower, and a sergeant in the National Guard. His name was Melusin. In all poor districts five o'clock is a busy hour for the shopkeepers, for the workmen are returning from their labors, and their wives are busy in their preparations for their evening meal. M. Melusin was so busily engaged, giving orders and seeing that they were executed, that he did not even notice the entrance of Daddy Tantaine; but had he done so, he would not have put himself out for so poorly dressed a customer. But the old man had left behind him in the Hotel de Perou every sign of humility and servility, and, making his way to the least crowded portion of the shop, he called out in imperative accents, \"M. Melusin!\"  Very much surprised, the grocer ceased his avocation and hastened to obey the summons. \"How the deuce does the man know me?\" muttered he, forgetting that his name was over the door in gilt letters fully six inches long.  \"Sir,\" said Daddy Tantaine, without giving the grocer time to speak, \"did not a young woman come here about half an hour ago and change a note for five hundred francs?\"  \"Most certainly,\" answered M. Melusin; \"but how did you know that? Ah, I have it!\" he added, striking his forehead; \"there has been a robbery, and you are in pursuit of the criminal. I must confess that the girl looked so poor, that I guessed there was something wrong. I saw her fingers tremble.\"  \"Pardon me,\" returned Daddy Tantaine. \"I have said nothing about a robbery. I only wished to ask you if you would know the girl again?\"  \"Perfectly--a really splendid girl, with hair that you do not see every day. I have reason to believe that she lives in the Rue Hachette. The police are not very popular with the shopkeeping class; but the latter, desirous of keeping down crime, generally afford plenty of information, and in the interests of virtue will even risk losing customers, who go off in a huff at not being attended to while they are talking to the officers of justice. Shall I,\" continued the grocer, \"send one of the errand boys to the nearest police station?\"  \"No, thank you,\" replied Daddy Tantaine. \"I should prefer your keeping the matter quiet until I communicate with you once more.\"  \"Yes, yes, I see; a false step just now would put them on their guard.\"  \"Just so. Now, will you let me have the number of the note, if you still have it? I wish you also to make a note of the date as well as the number.\"  \"Yes, yes, I see,\" returned the grocer. \"You may require my books as corroborative evidence; that is often the way. Excuse me; I will be back directly.\"  All that Daddy Tantaine had desired was executed with the greatest rapidity, and he and the grocer parted on the best terms, and the tradesman watched his visitor's departure, perfectly satisfied that he had been assisting a police officer who had deemed it fit to assume a disguise. Daddy Tantaine cared little what he thought, and, gaining the Place de Petit Pont, stopped and gazed around as if he was waiting for some one. Twice he walked round it in vain; but in his third circuit he came to a halt with an exclamation of satisfaction, for he had seen the person of whom he had been in search, who was a detestable looking youth of about eighteen years of age, though so thin and stunted that he hardly appeared to be fifteen.  The lad was leaning against the wall of the Quay St. Michel, openly asking alms, but keeping a sharp lookout for the police. At the first glance it was easy to detect in him the hideous outgrowth of the great city, the regular young rough of Paris, who, at eight years of age, smokes the butt ends of cigars picked up at the tavern doors and gets tipsy on coarse spirits. He had a thin crop of sandy hair, his complexion was dull and colorless, and a sneer curled the corners of his mouth, which had a thick, hanging underlip, and his eyes had an expression in them of revolting cynicism. His dress was tattered and dirty, and he had rolled up the sleeve of his right arm, exhibiting a deformed limb, sufficiently repulsive to excite the pity of the passers by. He was repeating a monotonous whine, in which the words \"poor workman, arm destroyed by machinery, aged mother to support,\" occurred continually.  Daddy Tantaine walked straight up to the youth, and with a sound cuff sent his hat flying.  The lad turned sharply round, evidently in a terrible rage; but, recognizing his assailant, shrank back, and muttered to himself, \"Landed!\" In an instant he restored his arm to its originally healthy condition, and, picking up his cap, replaced it on his head, and humbly waited for fresh orders.  \"Is this the way you execute your errands?\" asked Daddy Tantaine, snarling.  \"What errands? I have heard of none!\"  \"Never you mind that. Did not M. Mascarin, on my recommendation, put you in the way of earning your livelihood? and did you not promise to give up begging?\"  \"Beg pardon, guv'nor, I meant to be on the square, but I didn't like to waste time while I was a-waiting. I don't like a-being idle and I have copped seven browns.\"  \"Toto Chupin,\" said the old man, with great severity, \"you will certainly come to a bad end. But come, give your report. What have you seen?\"  During this conversation they were walking slowly along the quay, and had passed the Hotel Dieu.  \"Well, guv'nor,\" replied the young rogue, \"I just saw what you said I should. At four sharp, a carriage drove into the Place, and pulled up bang opposite the wigmaker's. Dash me, if it weren't a swell turnout!--horse, coachman, and all, in real slap-up style. It waited so long that I thought it had taken root there.\"  \"Come, get on! Was there any one inside?\"  \"I should think there was! I twigged him at once, by the description you gave me. I never see a cove togged out as he was,--tall hat, light sit-down-upons, and a short coat--wasn't it cut short! but in really bang-up style. To be certain, I went right up to him, for it was getting dark, and had a good look at him. He had got out of the trap, and was marching up and down the pavement, with an unlighted cigar stuck in his mouth. I took a match, and said, 'Have a light, my noble swell?' and hanged if he didn't give me ten centimes! My! ain't he ugly!--short, shrivelled up, and knock-kneed, with a glass in his eye, and altogether precious like a monkey.\"  Daddy Tantaine began to grow impatient with all this rigmarole. \"Come, tell me what took place,\" said he angrily.  \"Precious little. The young swell didn't seem to care about dirtying his trotter-cases; he kept slashing about with his cane, and staring at all the gals. What an ass that masher is! Wouldn't I have liked to have punched his head! If you ever want to hide him, daddy, please think of yours truly. He wouldn't stand up to me for five minutes.\"  \"Go on, my lad; go on.\"  \"Well, we had waited half an hour, when all at once a woman came sharp round the corner, and stops before the masher. Wasn't she a fine gal! and hadn't she a pair of sparklers! but she had awfully seedy togs on. But they spoke in whispers.\"  \"So you did not hear what they said?\"  \"Do you take me for a flat? The gal said, 'Do you understand?--to-morrow.' Then the swell chap, says he, 'Do you promise?' and the gal, she answers back, 'Yes, at noon.' Then they parted. She went off to the Rue Hachette, and the masher tumbled into his wheelbox. The jarvey cracked his whip, and off they went in a brace of shakes. Now hand over them five francs.\"  Daddy Tantaine did not seem surprised at this request, and he gave over the money to the young loafer, with the words, \"When I promise, I pay down on the nail; but remember Toto Chupin, you'll come to grief one day. Good-night. Our ways lie in different directions.\"  The old man, however, lingered until he had seen the lad go off toward the Jardin des Plantes, and then, turning round, went back by the way he had come. \"I have not lost my day,\" murmured he. \"All the improbabilities have turned out certainties, and matters are going straight. Won't Flavia be awfully pleased?\"    CHAPTER II.  A REGISTRY OFFICE.  The establishment of the influential friend of Daddy Tantaine was situated in the Rue Montorgeuil, not far from the Passage de la Reine Hortense. M. B. Mascarin has a registry office for the engagement of both male and female servants. Two boards fastened upon each side of the door announce the hours of opening and closing, and give a list of those whose names are on the books; they further inform the public that the establishment was founded in 1844, and is still in the same hands. It was the long existence of M. Mascarin in a business which is usually very short-lived that had obtained for him a great amount of confidence, not only in the quarter in which he resided, but throughout the whole of Paris. Employers say that he sends them the best of servants, and the domestics in their turn assert that he only despatches them to good places. But M. Mascarin has still further claims on the public esteem; for it was he who, in 1845, founded and carried out a project which had for its aim and end the securing of a shelter for servants out of place. The better to carry out this, Mascarin took a partner, and gave him the charge of a furnished house close to the office. Worthy as these projects were, Mascarin contrived to draw considerable profit from them, and was the owner of the house before which, in the noon of the day following the events we have described, Paul Violaine might have been seen standing. The five hundred francs of old Tantaine, or at any rate a portion of them, had been well spent, and his clothes did credit to his own taste and the skill of his tailor. Indeed, in his fine feathers he looked so handsome, that many women turned to gaze after him. He however took but little notice of this, for he was too full of anxiety, having grave doubts as to the power of the man whom Tantaine had asserted could, if he liked, make his fortune. \"A registry office!\" muttered he scornfully. \"Is he going to propose a berth of a hundred francs a month to me?\" He was much agitated at the thoughts of the impending interview, and, before entering the house, gazed upon its exterior with great interest. The house much resembled its neighbors. The entrances to the Registry Office and the Servants' Home were in the courtyard, at the arched entrance to which stood a vendor of roast chestnuts.  \"There is no use in remaining here,\" said Paul. Summoning, therefore, all his resolution, he crossed the courtyard, and, ascending a flight of stairs, paused before a door upon which \"OFFICE\" was written. \"Come in!\" responded at once to his knock. He pushed open the door, and entered a room, which closely resembled all other similar offices. There were seats all round the room, polished by frequent use. At the end was a sort of compartment shut in by a green baize curtain, jestingly termed \"the Confessional\" by the frequenters of the office. Between the windows was a tin plate, with the words, \"All fees to be paid in advance,\" in large letters upon it. In one corner a gentleman was seated at a writing table, who, as he made entries in a ledger, was talking to a woman who stood beside him.  \"M. Mascarin?\" asked Paul hesitatingly.  \"What do you want with him?\" asked the man, without looking up from his work. \"Do you wish to enter your name? We have now vacancies for three bookkeepers, a cashier, a confidential clerk--six other good situations. Can you give good references?\"  These words seemed to be uttered by rote.  \"I beg your pardon,\" returned Paul; \"but I should like to see M. Mascarin. One of his friends sent me here.\"  This statement evidently impressed the official, and he replied almost politely, \"M. Mascarin is much occupied at present, sir; but he will soon be disengaged. Pray be seated.\"  Paul sat down on a bench, and examined the man who had just spoken with some curiosity. M. Mascarin's partner was a tall and athletic man, evidently enjoying the best of health, and wearing a large moustache elaborately waxed and pointed. His whole appearance betokened the old soldier. He had, so he asserted, served in the cavalry, and it was there that he had acquired the _soubriquet_ by which he was known--Beaumarchef, his original name being David. He was about forty-five, but was still considered a very good-looking fellow. The entries that he was making in the ledger did not prevent him from keeping up a conversation with the woman standing by him. The woman, who seemed to be a cross between a cook and a market-woman, might be described as a thoroughly jovial soul. She seasoned her conversation with pinches of snuff, and spoke with a strong Alsatian brogue.  \"Now, look here,\" said Beaumarchef; \"do you really mean to say that you want a place?\"  \"I do that.\"  \"You said that six months ago. We got you a splendid one, and three days afterward you chucked up the whole concern.\"  \"And why shouldn't I? There was no need to work then; but now it is another pair of shoes, for I have spent nearly all I had saved.\"  Beaumarchef laid down his pen, and eyed her curiously for a second or two; then he said,--  \"You've been making a fool of yourself somehow, I expect.\"  She half turned away her head, and began to complain of the hardness of the terms and of the meanness of the mistresses, who, instead of allowing their cooks to do the marketing, did it themselves, and so cheated their servants out of their commissions.  Beaumarchef nodded, just as he had done half an hour before to a lady who had complained bitterly of the misconduct of her servants. He was compelled by his position to sympathize with both sides.  The woman had now finished her tirade, and drawing the amount of the fee from a well-filled purse, placed it on the table, saying,--  \"Please, M. Beaumarchef, register my name as Caroline Scheumal, and get me a real good place. It must be a cook, you understand, and I want to do the marketing without the missus dodging around.\"  \"Well, I'll do my best.\"  \"Try and find me a wealthy widower, or a young woman married to a very old fellow. Now, do look round; I'll drop in again to-morrow;\" and with a farewell pinch of snuff, she left the office.  Paul listened to this conversation with feelings of anger and humiliation, and in his heart cursed old Tantaine for having introduced him into such company. He was seeking for some plausible excuse for withdrawal, when the door at the end of the room was thrown open, and two men came in, talking as they did so. The one was young and well dressed, with an easy, swaggering manner, which ignorant people mistake for good breeding. He had a many-colored rosette at his buttonhole, showing that he was the knight of more than one foreign order. The other was an elderly man, with an unmistakable legal air about him. He was dressed in a quilted dressing-gown, fur-lined shoes, and had on his head an embroidered cap, most likely the work of the hands of some one dear to him. He wore a white cravat, and his sight compelled him to use colored glasses.  \"Then, my dear sir,\" said the younger man, \"I may venture to entertain hopes?\"  \"Remember, Marquis,\" returned the other, \"that if I were acting alone, what you require would be at once at your disposal. Unfortunately, I have others to consult.\"  \"I place myself entirely in your hands,\" replied the Marquis.  The appearance of the fashionably dressed young man reconciled Paul to the place in which he was.  \"A Marquis!\" he murmured; \"and the other swell-looking fellow must be M. Mascarin.\"  Paul was about to step forward, when Beaumarchef respectfully accosted the last comer,--  \"Who do you think, sir,\" said he, \"I have just seen?\"  \"Tell me quickly,\" was the impatient reply.  \"Caroline Schimmel; you know who I mean.\"  \"What! the woman who was in the service of the Duchess of Champdoce?\"  \"Exactly so.\"  M. Mascarin uttered an exclamation of delight.  \"Where is she living now?\"  Beaumarchef was utterly overwhelmed by this simple question. For the first time in his life he had omitted to take a client's address. This omission made Mascarin so angry that he forgot all his good manners, and broke out with an oath that would have shamed a London cabman,--  \"How could you be such an infernal fool? We have been hunting for this woman for five months. You knew this as well as I did, and yet, when chance brings her to you, you let her slip through your fingers and vanish again.\"  \"She'll be back again, sir; never fear. She won't fling away the money that she had paid for fees.\"  \"And what do you think that she cares for ten sous or ten francs? She'll be back when she thinks she will; but a woman who drinks and is off her head nearly all the year round----\"  Inspired by a sudden thought, Beaumarchef made a clutch at his hat.  \"She has only just gone,\" said he; \"I can easily overtake her.\"  But Mascarin arrested his progress.  \"You are not a good bloodhound. Take Toto Chupin with you; he is outside with his chestnuts, and is as fly as they make them. If you catch her up, don't say a word, but follow her up, and see where she goes. I want to know her whole daily life. Remember that no item, however unimportant it may seem, is not of consequence.\"  Beaumarchef disappeared in an instant, and Mascarin continued to grumble.  \"What a fool!\" he murmured. \"If I could only do everything myself. I worried my life out for months, trying to find the clue to the mystery which this woman holds, and now she has again escaped me.\"  Paul, who saw that his presence was not remarked, coughed to draw attention to it. In an instant Mascarin turned quickly round.  \"Excuse me,\" said Paul; but the set smile had already resumed its place upon Mascarin's countenance.  \"You are,\" remarked he, civilly, \"Paul Violaine, are you not?\"  The young man bowed in assent.  \"Forgive my absence for an instant. I will be back directly,\" said Mascarin.  He passed through the door, and in another instant Paul heard his name called.  Compared to the outer chamber, Mascarin's office was quite a luxurious apartment, for the windows were bright, the paper on the walls fresh, and the floor carpeted. But few of the visitors to the office could boast of having been admitted into this sanctum; for generally business was conducted at Beaumarchef's table in the outer room. Paul, however, who was unacquainted with the prevailing rule, was not aware of the distinction with which he had been received. Mascarin, on his visitor's entrance, was comfortably seated in an armchair before the fire, with his elbow on his desk--and what a spectacle did that desk present! It was a perfect world in itself, and indicated that its proprietor was a man of many trades. It was piled with books and documents, while a great deal of the space was occupied by square pieces of cardboard, upon each of which was a name in large letters, while underneath was writing in very minute characters.  With a benevolent gesture, Mascarin pointed to an armchair, and in encouraging tones said, \"And now let us talk.\"  It was plain to Paul that Mascarin was not acting, but that the kind and patriarchal expression upon his face was natural to it, and the young man felt that he could safely intrust his whole future to him.  \"I have heard,\" commenced Mascarin, \"that your means of livelihood are very precarious, or rather that you have none, and are ready to take the first one that offers you a means of subsistence. That, at least, is what I hear from my poor friend Tantaine.\"  \"He has explained my case exactly.\"  \"Good; only before proceeding to the future, let us speak of the past.\"  Paul gave a start, which Mascarin noticed, for he added,--  \"You will excuse the freedom I am taking; but it is absolutely necessary that I should know to what I am binding myself. Tantaine tells me that you are a charming young man, strictly honest, and well educated; and now that I have had the pleasure of meeting you, I am sure that he is right; but I can only deal with proofs, and must be quite certain before I act on your behalf with third parties.\"  \"I have nothing to conceal, sir, and am ready to answer any questions,\" responded Paul.  A slight smile, which Paul did not detect, played round the corners of Mascarin's mouth, and, with a gesture, with which all who knew him were familiar, he pushed back his glasses on his nose.  \"I thank you,\" answered he; \"it is not so easy as you may suppose to hide anything from me.\" He took one of the packets of pasteboard slips form his desk, and shuffling them like a pack of cards, continued, \"Your name is Marie Paul Violaine. You were born at Poitiers, in the Rue des Vignes, on the 5th of January, 1843, and are therefore in your twenty-fourth year.\"  \"That is quite correct, sir.\"  \"You are an illegitimate child?\"  The first question had surprised Paul; the second absolutely astounded him.  \"Quite true, sir,\" replied he, not attempting to hide his surprise; \"but I had no idea that M. Tantaine was so well informed; the partition which divided our rooms must have been thinner than I thought.\"  Mascarin took no notice of this remark, but continued to shuffle and examine his pieces of cardboard. Had Paul caught a clear glimpse of these, he would have seen his initials in the corner of each.  \"Your mother,\" went on Mascarin, \"kept, for the last fifteen years of her life, a little haberdasher's shop.\"  \"Just so.\"  \"But a business of that description in a town like Poitiers, does not bring in very remunerative results, and luckily she received for your support and education a sum of one thousand francs per year.\"  This time Paul started from his seat, for he was sure that Tantaine could not have learned this secret at the Hotel de Perou.  \"Merciful powers, sir!\" cried he; \"who could have told you a thing that has never passed my lips since my arrival in Paris, and of which even Rose is entirely ignorant?\"  Mascarin raised his shoulders.  \"You can easily comprehend,\" remarked he, \"that a man in my line of business has to learn many things. If I did not take the greatest precautions, I should be deceived daily, and so lead others into error.\"  Paul had not been more than an hour in the office, but the directions given to Beaumarchef had already taught him how many of these events were arranged.  \"Though I may be curious,\" went on Mascarin, \"I am the symbol of discretion; so answer me frankly: How did your mother receive this annuity?\"  \"Through a Parisian solicitor.\"  \"Do you know him?\"  \"Not at all,\" answered Paul, who had begun to grow uneasy under this questioning, for a kind of vague apprehension was aroused in his mind, and he could not see the utility of any of these interrogations. There was, however, nothing in Mascarin's manner to justify the misgivings of the young man, for he appeared to ask all these questions in quite a matter-of-course way, as if they were purely affairs of business.  After a protracted silence, Mascarin resumed,--  \"I am half inclined to believe that the solicitor sent the money on his own account.\"  \"No, sir,\" answered Paul. \"I am sure you are mistaken.\"  \"Why are you so certain?\"  \"Because my mother, who was the incarnation of truth, often assured me that my father died before my birth. Poor mother! I loved and respected her too much to question her on these matters. One day, however, impelled by an unworthy feeling of curiosity, I dared to ask her the name of our protector. She burst into tears, and then I felt how mean and cruel I had been. I never learned his name but I know that he was not my father.\"  Mascarin affected not to notice the emotion of his young client.  \"Did the allowance cease at your mother's death?\" continued he.  \"No; it was stopped when I came of age. My mother told me that this would be the case; but it seems only yesterday that she spoke to me of it. It was on my birthday, and she had prepared a little treat for my supper; for in spite of the affliction my birth had caused her, she loved me fondly. Poor mother! 'Paul,' said she, 'at your birth a genuine friend promised to help me to bring up and educate you, and he kept his word. But you are now twenty-one, and must expect nothing more from him. My son, you are a man now, and I have only you to look to. Work and earn an honest livelihood----'\"  Paul could proceed no farther, for his emotions choked him.  \"My mother died suddenly some ten months after this conversation--without time to communicate anything to me, and I was left perfectly alone in the world; and were I to die to-morrow, there would not be a soul to follow me to my grave.\"  Mascarin put on a sympathetic look.  \"Not quite so bad as that, my young friend; I trust that you have one now.\"  Mascarin rose from his seat, and for a few minutes paced up and down the room, and then halted, with his arms folded, before the young man.  \"You have heard me,\" said he, \"and I will not put any further questions which it will but pain you to reply to, for I only wished to take your measure, and to judge of your truth from your replies. You will ask why? Ah, that is a question I cannot answer to-day, but you shall know later on. Be assured, however, that I know everything about you, but I cannot tell you by what means. Say it has all happened by chance. Chance has broad shoulders, and can bear a great deal.\"  This ambiguous speech caused a thrill of terror to pass through Paul, which was plainly visible on his expressive features.  \"Are you alarmed?\" asked Mascarin, readjusting his spectacles.  \"I am much surprised, sir,\" stammered Paul.  \"Come, come! what can a man in your circumstances have to fear? There is no use racking your brain; you will find out all you want quickly enough, and had best make up your mind to place yourself in my hands without reserve, for my sole desire is to be of service to you.\"  These words were uttered in the most benevolent manner; and as he resumed his seat, he added,--  \"Now let us talk of myself. Your mother, whom you justly say was a thoroughly good woman, pinched herself in order to keep you at college at Poitiers. You entered a solicitor's office at eighteen, I think?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"But your mother's desire was to see you established at Loudon or Cevray. Perhaps she hoped that her wealthy friend would aid you still further. Unluckily, however, you had no inclination for the law.\"  Paul smiled, but Mascarin went on with some little severity.  \"I repeat, unfortunately; and I think that by this time you have gone through enough to be of my opinion. What did you do instead of studying law? You did--what? You wasted your time over music, and composed songs, and, I know, an opera, and thought yourself a perfect genius.\"  Paul had listened up to this time with patience, but at this sarcasm he endeavored to protest; but it was in vain, for Mascarin went on pitilessly,--  \"One day you abandoned the study of the law, and told your mother that until you had made your name as a musical composer you would give lessons on the piano; but you could obtain no pupils, and--well, just look in the glass yourself, and say if you think that your age and appearance would justify parents in intrusting their daughters to your tuition?\"  Mascarin stopped for a moment and consulted his notes afresh.  \"Your departure from Poitiers,\" he went on, \"was your last act of folly. The very day after your poor mother's death you collected together all her scanty savings, and took the train to Paris.\"  \"Then, sir, I had hoped----\"  \"What, to arrive at fortune by the road of talent? Foolish boy! Every year a thousand poor wretches have been thus intoxicated by their provincial celebrity, and have started for Paris, buoyed up by similar hopes. Do you know the end of them? At the end of ten years--I give them no longer--nine out of ten die of starvation and disappointment, and the other joins the criminal army.\"  Paul had often repeated this to himself, and could, therefore, make no reply.  \"But,\" went on Mascarin, \"you did not leave Poitiers alone; you carried off with you a young girl named Rose Pigoreau.\"  \"Pray, let me explain.\"  \"It would be useless. The fact speaks for itself. In six months your little store had disappeared; then came poverty and starvation, and at last, in the Hotel de Perou, your thoughts turned to suicide, and you were only saved by my old friend Tantaine.\"  Paul felt his temper rising, for these plain truths were hard to bear; but fear lest he should lose his protector kept him silent.  \"I admit everything, sir,\" said he calmly. \"I was a fool, and almost mad, but experience has taught me a bitter lesson. I am here to-day, and this fact should tell you that I have given up all my vain hallucinations.\"  \"Will you give up Rose Pigoreau?\"  As this abrupt question was put to him, Paul turned pale with anger.  \"I love Rose,\" answered he coldly; \"she believes in me, and has shared my troubles with courage, and one day she shall be my wife.\"  Raising his velvet cap from his head, Mascarin bowed with an ironical air, saying, \"Is that so? Then I beg a thousand pardons. It is urgent that you should have immediate employment. Pray, what can you do? Not much of anything, I fancy;--like most college bred boys, you can do a little of everything, and nothing well. Had I a son, and an enormous income, I would have him taught a trade.\"  Paul bit his lip; but he knew the portrait was a true one.  \"And now,\" continued Mascarin, \"I have come to your aid, and what do you say to a situation with a salary of twelve thousand francs?\"  This sum was so much greater than Paul had dared to hope, that he believed Mascarin was amusing himself at his expense.  \"It is not kind of you to laugh at me, under the present circumstances,\" remarked he.  Mascarin was not laughing at him; but it was fully half an hour before he could prove this to Paul.  \"You would like more proof of what I say,\" said he, after a long conversation. \"Very well, then; shall I advance your first month's salary?\" And as he spoke, he took a thousand-franc note from his desk, and offered it to Paul. The young man rejected the note; but the force of the argument struck him; and he asked if he was capable of carrying out the duties which such a salary doubtless demanded.  \"Were I not certain of your abilities, I should not offer it to you,\" replied Mascarin. \"I am in a hurry now, or I would explain the whole affair; but I must defer doing so until to-morrow, when please come at the same hour as you did to-day.\"  Even in his state of surprise and stupefaction, Paul felt that this was a signal for him to depart.  \"A moment more,\" said Mascarin. \"You understand that you can no longer remain at the Hotel de Perou? Try and find a room in this neighborhood; and when you have done so, leave the address at the office. Good-bye, my young friend, until to-morrow, and learn to bear good fortune.\"  For a few minutes Mascarin stood at the door of the office watching Paul, who departed almost staggering beneath the burden of so many conflicting emotions; and when he saw him disappear round the corner, he ran to a glazed door which led to his bed chamber, and in a loud whisper called, \"Come in, Hortebise. He has gone.\"  A man obeyed the summons at once, and hurriedly drew up a chair to the fire. \"My feet are almost frozen,\" exclaimed he; \"I should not know it if any one was to chop them off. Your room, my dear Baptiste, is a perfect refrigerator. Another time, please, have a fire lighted in it.\"  This speech, however, did not disturb Mascarin's line of thought. \"Did you hear all?\" asked he.  \"I saw and heard all that you did.\"  \"And what do you think of the lad?\"  \"I think that Daddy Tantaine is a man of observation and powerful will, and that he will mould this child between his fingers like wax.\"    CHAPTER III.  THE OPINION OF DR. HORTEBISE.  Dr. Hortebise, who had addressed Mascarin so familiarly by his Christian name of Baptiste, was about fifty-six years of age, but he carried his years so well, that he always passed for forty-nine. He had a heavy pair of red, sensual-looking lips, his hair was untinted by gray, and his eyes still lustrous. A man who moved in the best society, eloquent in manner, a brilliant conversationalist, and vivid in his perceptions, he concealed under the veil of good-humored sarcasm the utmost cynicism of mind. He was very popular and much sought after. He had but few faults, but quite a catalogue of appalling vices. Under this Epicurean exterior lurked, it was reported, the man of talent and the celebrated physician. He was not a hard-working man, simply because he achieved the same results without toil or labor. He had recently taken to homoeopathy, and started a medical journal, which he named _The Globule_, which died at its fifth number. His conversation made all society laugh, and he joined in the ridicule, thus showing the sincerity of his views, for he was never able to take the round of life seriously. To-day, however, Mascarin, well as he knew his friend, seemed piqued at his air of levity.  \"When I asked you to come here to-day,\" said he, \"and when I begged you to conceal yourself in my bedroom--\"  \"Where I was half frozen,\" broke in Hortebise.  \"It was,\" went on Mascarin, \"because I desired your advice. We have started on a serious undertaking,--an undertaking full of peril both to you and to myself.\"  \"Pooh! I have perfect confidence in you,--whatever you do is done well, and you are not the man to fling away your trump cards.\"  \"True; but I may lose the game, after all, and then----\"  The doctor merely shook a large gold locket that depended from his watch chain.  This movement seemed to annoy Mascarin a great deal. \"Why do you flash that trinket at me?\" asked he. \"We have known each other for five and twenty years,--what do you mean to imply? Do you mean that the locket contains the likeness of some one that you intend to make use of later on? I think that you might render such a step unnecessary by giving me your present advice and attention.\"  Hortebise threw himself back in his chair with an expression of resignation. \"If you want advice,\" remarked he, \"why not apply to our worthy friend Catenac?--he knows something of business, as he is a lawyer.\"  The name of Catenac seemed to irritate Mascarin so much, that calm, and self-contained as he usually was, he pulled off his cap and dashed it on his desk.  \"Are you speaking seriously?\" said he angrily.  \"Why should I not be in earnest?\"  Mascarin removed his glasses, as though without them he could the more easily peer into the depths of the soul of the man before him.  \"Because,\" replied he slowly, \"both you and I distrust Catenac. When did you see him last?\"  \"More than three months ago.\"  \"True, and I allow that he seems to be acting fairly toward his old associates; but you will admit that, in keeping away thus, his conduct is without excuse, for he has made his fortune; and though he pretends to be poor, he is certainly a man of wealth.\"  \"Do you really think so?\"  \"Were he here, I would force him to acknowledge that he is worth a million, at least.\"  \"A million!\" exclaimed the doctor, with sudden animation.  \"Yes, certainly. You and I, Hortebise, have indulged our every whim, and have spent gold like water, while our friend garnered his harvest and stored it away. But poor Catenac has no expensive tastes, nor does he care for women or the pleasures of the table. While we indulged in every pleasure, he lent out his money at usurious interest. But, stop,--how much do you spend per annum?\"  \"That is a hard question to answer; but, say, forty thousand francs.\"  \"More, a great deal more; but calculate what a capital sum that would amount to during the twenty years we have done business together.\"  The doctor was not clever at figures; he made several vain attempts to solve the problem, and at last gave it up in despair. \"Forty and forty,\" muttered he, tapping the tips of his fingers, \"are eighty, then forty--\"  \"Call it eight hundred thousand francs,\" broke in Mascarin. \"Say I drew the same amount as you did. We have spent ours, and Catenac has saved his, and grown rich; hence my distrust. Our interests are no longer identical. He certainly comes here every month, but it is only to claim his share; he consents to take his share of the profits, but shirks the risks. It is fully ten years since he brought in any business. I don't trust him at all. He always declines to join in any scheme that we propose, and sees danger in everything.\"  \"He would not betray us, however.\"  Mascarin took a few moments for reflection. \"I think,\" said he, \"that Catenac is afraid of us. He knows that the ruin of me would entail the destruction of the other two. This is our only safeguard; but if he dare not injure us openly, he is quite capable of working against us in secret. Do you remember what he said the last time he was here? That we ought to close our business and retire. How should _we_ live? for he is rich and we are poor. What on earth are you doing, Hortebise?\" he added, for the physician, who had the reputation of being worth an enormous amount, had taken out his purse, and was going over the contents.  \"I have scarcely three hundred and twenty-seven francs!\" answered he with a laugh. \"What is the state of your finances?\"  Mascarin made a grimace. \"I am not so well off as you; and besides,\" he continued in a low voice, as though speaking to himself, \"I have certain ties which you do not possess.\"  For the first time during this interview a cloud spread over the doctor's countenance.  \"Great Heavens!\" said he, \"and I was depending on you for three thousand francs, which I require urgently.\"  Mascarin smiled slyly at the doctor's uneasiness. \"Don't worry,\" he answered. \"You can have that; there ought to be some six or eight thousand francs in the safe. But that is all, and that is the last of our common capital,--this after twenty years of toil, danger, and anxiety, and we have not twenty years before us to make a fresh fortune in.\"  \"Yes,\" continued Mascarin, \"we are getting old, and therefore have the greater reason for making one grand stroke to assure our fortune. Were I to fall ill to-morrow, all would go to smash.\"  \"Quite true,\" returned the doctor, with a slight shudder.  \"We must, and that is certain, venture on a bold stroke. I have said this for years, and woven a web of gigantic proportions. Do you now know why at this last moment I appeal to you, and not to Catenac for assistance? If only one out of two operations that I have fully explained to you succeeds, our fortune is made.\"  \"I follow you exactly.\"  \"The question now is whether the chance of success is sufficiently great to warrant our going on with these undertakings. Think it over and let me have your opinion.\"  An acute observer could easily have seen that the doctor was a man of resource, and a thoroughly competent adviser, for the reason that his coolness never deserted him. Compelled to choose between the use of the contents of his locket, or the continuance of a life of luxurious ease, the smile vanished from the doctor's face, and he began to reflect profoundly. Leaning back in his chair, with his feet resting on the fender, he carefully studied every combination in the undertaking, as a general inspects the position taken up by the enemy, when a battle is impending, upon which the fate of an empire may hinge. That this analysis took a favorable turn, was evident, for Mascarin soon saw a smile appear upon the doctor's lips. \"We must make the attack at once,\" said he; \"but make no mistake; the projects you propose are most dangerous, and a single error upon our side would entail destruction; but we must take some risk. The odds are against us, but still we may win. Under these circumstances, and as necessity cheers us on, I say, _Forward!_\" As he said this, he rose to his feet, and extending his hand toward his friend, exclaimed, \"I am entirely at your disposal.\"  Mascarin seemed relieved by the doctor's decision, for he was in that frame of mind when, however self-reliant a man may be, he has a disinclination to be left alone, and the aid of a stout ally is of the utmost service.  \"Have you considered every point carefully?\" asked he. \"You know that we can only act at present upon one of the undertakings, and that is the one of which the Marquis de Croisenois----\"  \"I know that.\"  \"With reference to the affair of the Duke de Champdoce, I have still to gather together certain things necessary for the ultimate success of the scheme. There is a mystery in the lives of the Duke and Duchess,--of this there is no doubt,--but what is this secret? I would lay my life that I have hit upon the correct solution; but I want no suspicions, no probabilities; I want absolute certainties. And now,\" continued he, \"this brings us back to the first question. What do you think of Paul Violaine?\"  Hortebise walked up and down the room two or three times, and finally stopped opposite to his friend. \"I think,\" said he, \"that the lad has many of the qualities we want, and we might find it hard to discover one better suited for our purpose. Besides, he is a bastard, knows nothing of his father, and therefore leaves a wide field for conjecture; for every natural son has the right to consider himself, if he likes, the offspring of a monarch. He has no family or any one to look after him, which assures us that whatever may happen, there is no one to call us to account. He is not overwise, but has a certain amount of talent, and any quantity of ridiculous self-conceit. He is wonderfully handsome, which will make matters easier, but--\"  \"Ah, there is a 'but' then?\"  \"More than one,\" answered the doctor, \"for there are three for certain. First, there is Rose Pigoreau, whose beauty has so captivated our old friend Tantaine,--she certainly appears to be a danger in the future.\"  \"Be easy,\" returned Mascarin; \"we will quickly remove this young woman from our road.\"  \"Good; but do not be too confident,\" answered Hortebise, in his usual tone. \"The danger from her is not the one you think, and which you are trying to avoid. You think Paul loves her. You are wrong. He would drop her to-morrow, so that he could please his self-indulgence. But the woman who thinks that she hates her lover often deceives herself; and Rose is simply tired of poverty. Give her a little amount of comfort, good living, and luxury, and you will see her give them all up to come back to Paul. Yes, I tell you, she will harass and annoy him, as women of her class who have nothing to love always do. She will even go to Flavia to claim him.\"  \"She had better not,\" retorted Mascarin, in threatening accents.  \"Why, how could you prevent it? She has known Paul from his infancy. She knew his mother; she was perhaps brought up by her, perhaps even lived in the same street. Look out, I say, for danger from that quarter.\"  \"You may be right, and I will take my precautions.\"  It was sufficient for Mascarin to be assured of a danger to find means of warding it off.  \"My second 'but,'\" continued Hortebise, \"is the idea of the mysterious protector of whom the young man spoke. His mother, he says, has reason to know that his father is dead, and I believe in the truth of the statement. In this case, what has become of the person who paid Madame Violaine her allowance?\"  \"You are right, quite right; these are the crevices in our armor; but I keep my eyes open, and nothing escapes me.\"  The doctor was growing rather weary, but he still went on courageously. \"My third 'but'\" said he, \"is perhaps the strongest. We must see the young fellow at once. It may be to-morrow, without even having prepared him or taught him his part. Suppose we found that he was honest! Imagine--if he returned a firm negative to all your dazzling offers!\"  Mascarin rose to his feet in his turn. \"I do not think that there is any chance of that,\" said he.  \"Why not, pray?\"  \"Because when Tantaine brought him to me, he had studied him carefully. He is as weak as a woman, and as vain as a journalist. Besides, he is ashamed at being poor. No; I can mould him like wax into any shape I like. He will be just what we wish.\"  \"Are you sure,\" asked Hortebise, \"that Flavia will have nothing to say in this matter?\"  \"I had rather, with your permission, say nothing on that head,\" returned Mascarin. He broke off his speech and listened eagerly. \"There is some one listening,\" said he. \"Hark!\"  The sound was repeated, and the doctor was about to seek refuge in the inner room, when Mascarin laid a detaining hand upon his arm.  \"Stay,\" observed he, \"it is only Beaumarchef;\" and as he spoke, he struck a gilded bell that stood on his desk. In another instant Beaumarchef appeared, and with an air in which familiarity was mingled with respect, he saluted in military fashion.  \"Ah,\" said the doctor pleasantly, \"do you take your nips of brandy regularly?\"  \"Only occasionally, sir,\" stammered the man.  \"Too often, too often, my good fellow. Do you think that your nose and eyelids are not real telltales?\"  \"But I assure you, sir--\"  \"Do you not remember I told you that you had asthmatic symptoms? Why, the movement of your pectoral muscles shows that your lungs are affected.\"  \"But I have been running, sir.\"  Mascarin broke in upon this conversation, which he considered frivolous. \"If he is out of breath,\" remarked he, \"it is because he has been endeavoring to repair a great act of carelessness that he has committed. Well, Beaumarchef, how did you get on?\"  \"All right, sir,\" returned he, with a look of triumph. \"Good!\"  \"What are you talking about?\" asked the doctor.  Mascarin gave his friend a meaning glance, and then, in a careless manner, replied, \"Caroline Schimmel, a former servant of the Champdoce family, also patronizes our office. How did you find her, Beaumarchef?\"  \"Well, an idea occurred to me.\"  \"Pooh! do you have ideas at your time of life?\"  Beaumarchef put on an air of importance. \"My idea was this,\" he went on: \"as I left the office with Toto Chupin, I said to myself, the woman would certainly drop in at some pub before she reached the boulevard.\"  \"A sound argument,\" remarked the doctor.  \"Therefore Toto and I took a squint into every one we passed, and before we got to the Rue Carreau we saw her in one, sure enough.\"  \"And Toto is after her now?\"  \"Yes, sir; he said he would follow her like her shadow, and will bring in a report every day.\"  \"I am very pleased with you, Beaumarchef,\" said Mascarin, rubbing his hands joyously.  Beaumarchef seemed highly flattered, but continued,--  \"This is not all.\"  \"What else is there to tell?\"  \"I met La Candele on his way from the Place de Petit Pont, and he has just seen that young girl--you know whom I mean--driving off in a two-horse Victoria. He followed it, of course. She has been placed in a gorgeous apartment in the Rue Douai; and from what the porter says, she must be a rare beauty; and La Candele raved about her, and says that she has the most magnificent eyes in the world.\"  \"Ah,\" remarked Hortebise, \"then Tantaine was right in his description of her.\"  \"Of course he was,\" answered Mascarin with a slight frown, \"and this proves the justice of the objection you made a little time back. A girl possessed of such dazzling beauty may even influence the fool who has carried her off to become dangerous.\"  Beaumarchef touched his master's arm kindly. \"If you wish to get rid of the masher,\" said he, \"I can show you a way;\" and throwing himself into the position of a fencer, he made a lunge with his right arm, exclaiming, \"One, two!\"  \"A Prussian quarrel,\" remarked Mascarin. \"No; a duel would do us no good. We should still have the girl on our hands, and violent measures are always to be avoided.\" He took off his glasses, wiped them, and looking at the doctor intently, said, \"Suppose we take an epidemic as our ally. If the girl had the smallpox, she would lose her beauty.\"  Cynical and hardened as the doctor was, he drew back in horror at this proposal. \"Under certain circumstances,\" remarked he, \"science might aid us; but Rose, even without her beauty, would be just as dangerous as she is now. It is _her_ affection for Paul that we have to check, and not _his_ for her; and the uglier a woman is, the more she clings to her lover.\"  \"All this is worthy of consideration,\" returned Mascarin; \"meanwhile we must take steps to guard ourselves from the impending danger. Have you finished that report on Gandelu, Beaumarchef? What is his position?\"  \"Head over ears in debt, sir, but not harassed by his creditors because of his future prospects.\"  \"Surely among these creditors there are some that we could influence?\" said Mascarin. \"Find this out, and report to me this evening; and farewell for the present.\"  When again alone, the two confederates remained silent for some time. The decisive moment had arrived. As yet they were not compromised; but if they intended to carry out their plans, they must no longer remain inactive; and both of these men had sufficient experience to know that they must look at the position boldly, and make up their minds at once. The pleasant smile upon the doctor's face faded away, and his fingers played nervously with his locket. Mascarin was the first to break the silence.  \"Let us no longer hesitate,\" said he; \"let us shut our eyes to the danger and advance steadily. You heard the promises made by the Marquis de Croisenois. He will do as we wish, but under certain conditions. Mademoiselle de Mussidan must be his bride.\"  \"That will be impossible.\"  \"Not so, if we desire it: and the proof of this is, that before two o'clock the engagement between Mademoiselle Sabine and the Baron de Breulh-Faverlay will be broken off.\"  The doctor heaved a deep sigh. \"I can understand Catenac's scruples. Ah! if, like him, I had a million!\"  During this brief conversation Mascarin had gone into his sleeping room and was busily engaged in changing his dress.  \"If you are ready,\" remarked the doctor, \"we will make a start.\"  In reply, Mascarin opened the door leading into the office. \"Get a cab, Beaumarchef,\" said he.    CHAPTER IV.  A TRUSTWORTHY SERVANT.  In the City of Paris it is impossible to find a more fashionable quarter than the one which is bounded on the one side by the Rue Faubourg Saint Honore and on the other by the Seine, and commences at the Place de la Concorde and ends at the Avenue de l'Imperatrice. In this favored spot millionaires seem to bloom like the rhododendron in the sunny south. There are the magnificent palaces which they have erected for their accommodation, where the turf is ever verdant, and where the flowers bloom perennially; but the most gorgeous of all these mansions was the Hotel de Mussidan, the last _chef d'oeuvre_ of Sevair, that skilful architect who died just as the world was beginning to recognize his talents. With a spacious courtyard in front and a magnificent garden in the rear, the Hotel de Mussidan is as elegant as it is commodious. The exterior was extremely plain, and not disfigured by florid ornamentation. White marble steps, with a light and elegant railing at the sides, lead to the wide doors which open into the hall. The busy hum of the servants at work at an early hour in the yard tells that an ample establishment is kept up. There can be seen luxurious carriages, for occasions of ceremony, and the park phaeton, and the simple brougham which the Countess uses when she goes out shopping; and that carefully groomed thoroughbred is Mirette, the favorite riding horse of Mademoiselle Sabine. Mascarin and his confederate descended from their cab a little distance at the corner of the Avenue Matignon. Mascarin, in his dark suit, with his spotless white cravat and glittering spectacles, looked like some highly respectable functionary of State. Hortebise wore his usual smile, though his cheek was pale.  \"Now,\" remarked Mascarin, \"let me see,--on what footing do you stand with the Mussidans? Do they look upon you as a friend?\"  \"No, no; a poor doctor, whose ancestors were not among the Crusades, could not be the intimate friend of such haughty nobles as the Mussidans.\"  \"But the Countess knows you, and will not refuse to receive you, nor have you turned out as soon as you begin to speak; for, taking shelter behind some rogue without a name, you can shelter your own reputation. I will see the Count.\"  \"Take care of him,\" said Hortebise thoughtfully. \"He has a reputation for being a man of ungovernable temper, and, at the first word from you that he objects to, would throw you out of the window as soon as look at you.\"  Mascarin shrugged his shoulders. \"I can bring him to reason,\" answered he.  The two confederates walked a little past the Hotel de Mussidan, and the doctor explained the interior arrangements of the house.  \"I,\" continued Mascarin, \"will insist upon the Count's breaking off his daughter's engagement with M. de Breulh-Faverlay, but shall not say a word about the Marquis de Croisenois, while you will take the opportunity of putting his pretensions before the Countess, and will not say a word of M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"  \"I have learned my lesson, and shall not forget it.\"  \"You see, doctor, the beauty of the whole affair is, that the Countess will wonder how her husband will take her interference, while he will be at a loss how to break the news to his wife. How surprised they will be when they find that they have both the same end in view!\"  There was something so droll in the whole affair, that the doctor burst into a loud laugh.  \"We go by such different roads,\" said he, \"that they will never suspect that we are working together. Faith! my dear Baptiste, you are much more clever than I thought.\"  \"Don't praise me until you see that I am successful.\"  Mascarin stopped opposite to a _café_ in the Faubourg Saint Honore.  \"Wait here for me, doctor,\" said he, \"while I make a little call. If all is all right; I will come for you again; then I will see the Count, and twenty minutes later do you go to the house and ask for the Countess.\"  The clock struck four as the worthy confederates parted, and Mascarin continued his way along the Faubourg Saint Honore, and again stopped before a public house, which he entered, the master of which, Father Canon, was so well known in the neighborhood that he had not thought it worth while to have his name painted over the door. He did not profess to serve his best wine to casual customers, but for regular frequenters of his house, chiefly the servants of noble families, he kept a better brand of wine. Mascarin's respectable appearance inclined the landlord to step forward. Among Frenchmen, who are always full of gayety, a serious exterior is ever an excellent passport.  \"What can I do for you, sir?\" asked he with great politeness.  \"Can I see Florestan?\"  \"In Count de Mussidan's service, I believe?\"  \"Just so; I have an appointment with him here.\"  \"He is downstairs in the band-room,\" replied the landlord. \"I will send for him.\"  \"Don't trouble; I will go down,\" and, without waiting for permission, Mascarin descended some steps that apparently led to a cellar.  \"It appears to me,\" murmured Father Canon, \"that I have seen this cove's face before.\"  Mascarin pushed open a door at the bottom of the flight of stairs, and a strange and appalling noise issued from within (but this neither surprised nor alarmed him), and entered a vaulted room arranged like a _café_, with seats and tables, filled with customers. In the centre, two men, in their shirt sleeves, with crimson faces, were performing upon horns; while an old man, with leather gaiters, buttoning to the knee, and a broad leather belt, was whistling the air the hornplayers were executing. As Mascarin politely took off his hat, the performers ceased, and the old man discontinued his whistling, while a well-built young fellow, with pumps and stockings, and wearing a fashionable mustache, exclaimed,--  \"Aha, it is that good old Mascarin. I was expecting you; will you drink?\"  Without waiting for further invitation Mascarin helped himself from a bottle that stood near.  \"Did Father Canon tell you that I was here?\" asked the young man, who was the Florestan Mascarin had been inquiring for. \"You see,\" continued he, \"that the police will not permit us to practise the horn; so, you observe, Father Canon has arranged this underground studio, from whence no sound reaches the upper world.\"  The hornplayers had now resumed their lessons, and Florestan was compelled to place both hands to the side of his mouth, in order to render himself audible, and to shout with all his might.  \"That old fellow there is a huntsman in the service of the Duke de Champdoce, and is the finest hornplayer going. I have only had twenty lessons from him, and am getting on wonderfully.\"  \"Ah!\" exclaimed Mascarin, \"when I have more time I must hear your performance; but to-day I am in a hurry, and want to say a few words to you in private.\"  \"Certainly, but suppose we go upstairs and ask for a private room.\"  The rooms he referred to were not very luxuriously furnished, but were admirably suited for confidential communications; and had the walls been able to speak, they could have told many a strange tale.  Florestan and Mascarin seated themselves in one of these before a small table, upon which Father Canon placed a bottle of wine and two glasses.  \"I asked you to meet me here, Florestan,\" began Mascarin, \"because you can do me a little favor.\"  \"Anything that is in my power I will do,\" said the young man.  \"First, a few words regarding yourself. How do you get on with Count de Mussidan?\"  Mascarin had adopted an air of familiarity which he knew would please his companion.  \"I don't care about the place,\" replied Florestan, \"and I am going to ask Beaumarchef to look out another one for me.\"  \"I am surprised at that; all your predecessors said that the Count was a perfect gentleman--\"  \"Just try him yourself,\" broke in the valet. \"In the first place he is as fickle as the wind, and awfully suspicious. He never leaves anything about,--no letters, no cigars, and no money. He spends half his time in locking things up, and goes to bed with his keys under his pillow.\"  \"I allow that such suspicion on his part is most unpleasant.\"  \"It is indeed, and besides he is awfully violent. He gets in a rage about nothing, and half a dozen times in the day he looks ready to murder you. On my word, I am really frightened at him.\"  This account, coupled with what he had heard from Hortebise seemed to render Mascarin very thoughtful.  \"Is he always like this, or only at intervals?\"  \"He is always a beast, but he is worse after drink or losing at cards. He is never home until after four in the morning.\"  \"And what does his wife say?\"  The query made Florestan laugh.  \"Madame does not bother herself about her lord and master, I can assure you. Sometimes they don't meet for weeks. All she wants is plenty of money. And ain't we just dunned!\"  \"But the Mussidans are wealthy?\"  \"Tremendously so, but at times there is not the value of a franc in the house. Then Madame is like a tigress, and would sent to borrow from all her friends.\"  \"But she must feel much humiliated?\"  \"Not a bit; when she wants a heavy amount, she sends off to the Duke de Champdoce, and he always parts; but she doesn't mince matters with him.\"  \"It would seem as if you had known the contents of your mistress's letters?\" remarked Mascarin with a smile.  \"Of course I have; I like to know what is in the letters I carry about. She only says, 'My good friend, I want so much,' and back comes the money without a word. Of course it is easy to see that there has been something between them.\"  \"Yes, evidently.\"  \"And when master and missus do meet they only have rows, and such rows! When the working man has had a drop too much, he beats his wife, she screams, then they kiss and make it up; but the Mussidans say things to each other in cold blood that neither can ever forgive.\"  From the air with which Mascarin listened to these details, it almost seemed as if he had been aware of them before.  \"Then,\" said he, \"Mademoiselle Sabine is the only nice one in the house?\"  \"Yes, she is always gentle and considerate.\"  \"Then you think that M. de Breulh-Faverlay will be a happy man?\"  \"Oh, yes; but perhaps this marriage will----\" but here Florestan interrupted himself and assumed an air of extreme caution. After looking carefully round, he lowered his voice, and continued, \"Mademoiselle Sabine has been left so much to herself that she acts just as she thinks fit.\"  \"Do you mean,\" asked Mascarin, \"that the young lady has a lover?\"  \"Just so.\"  \"But that must be wrong; and let me tell you that you ought not to repeat such a story.\"  The man grew quite excited.  \"Story,\" repeated he; \"I know what I know. If I spoke of a lover, it is because I have seen him with my own eyes, not once, but twice.\"  From the manner in which Mascarin received this intelligence, Florestan saw that he was interested in the highest degree.  \"I'll tell you all about it,\" continued he. \"The first time was when she went to mass; it came on to rain suddenly, and Modeste, her maid, begged me to go for an umbrella. As soon as I came back I went in and saw Mademoiselle Sabine standing by the receptacle for holy water, talking to a young fellow. Of course I dodged behind a pillar, and kept a watch on the pair--\"  \"But you don't found all your story on this?\"  \"I think you would, had you seen the way they looked into each other's eyes.\"  \"What was he like?\"  \"Very good looking, about my height, with an aristocratic air.\"  \"How about the second time?\"  \"Ah, that is a longer story. I went one day with Mademoiselle when she was going to see a friend in the Rue Marboeuf. She waited at a corner of the street, and beckoned me to her. 'Florestan,' said she, 'I forgot to post this letter; go and do so; I will wait here for you.'\"  \"Of course you read it?\"  \"No. I thought there was something wrong. She wants to get rid of you, so, instead of posting it, I slunk behind a tree and waited. I had hardly done so, when the young fellow I had seen at the chapel came round the corner; but I scarcely knew him. He was dressed just like a working man, in a blouse all over plaster. They talked for about ten minutes, and Mademoiselle Sabine gave him what looked like a photograph.\"  By this time the bottle was empty, and Florestan was about to call for another, when Mascarin checked him, saying--  \"Not to-day; it is growing late, and I must tell you what I want you to do for me. Is the Count at home now?\"  \"Of course he is; he has not left his room for two days, owing to having slipped going downstairs.\"  \"Well, my lad, I must see your master; and if I sent up my card, the odds are he would not see me, so I rely upon you to show me up without announcing me.\"  Florestan remained silent for a few minutes.  \"It is no easy job,\" he muttered, \"for the Count does not like unexpected visitors, and the Countess is with him just now. However, as I am not going to stay, I'll chance it.\"  Mascarin rose from his seat.  \"We must not be seen together,\" said he; \"I'll settle the score; do you go on, and I will follow in five minutes. Remember we don't know each other.\"  \"I am fly; and mind you look out a good place for me.\"  Mascarin paid the bill, and then looked into the _café_ to inform the doctor of his movements, and a few minutes later, Florestan in his most sonorous voice, threw open the door of his master's room and announced,--  \"M. Mascarin.\"    CHAPTER V.  A FORGOTTEN CRIME.  Baptiste Mascarin had been in so many strange situations, from which he had extricated himself with safety and credit, that he had the fullest self-confidence, but as he ascended the wide staircase of the Hotel de Mussidan, he felt his heart beat quicker in anticipation of the struggle that was before him. It was twilight out of doors, but all within was a blaze of light. The library into which he was ushered was a vast apartment, furnished in severe taste. At the sound of the unaristocratic name of Mascarin, which seemed as much out of place as a drunkard's oath in the chamber of sleeping innocence, M. de Mussidan raised his head in sudden surprise. The Count was seated at the other end of the room, reading by the light of four candles placed in a magnificently wrought candelabra. He threw down his paper, and raising his glasses, gazed with astonishment at Mascarin, who, with his hat in his hand and his heart in his mouth, slowly crossed the room, muttering a few unintelligible apologies. He could make nothing, however, of his visitor, and said, \"Whom do you wish to see, sir?\"  \"The Count de Mussidan,\" stuttered Mascarin; \"and I hope that you will forgive this intrusion.\"  The Count cut his excuse short with a haughty wave of his hand. \"Wait,\" said he imperiously. He then with evident pain rose from his seat, and crossing the room, rang the bell violently, and then reseated himself. Mascarin, who still remained in the centre of the room, inwardly wondered if after all he was to be turned out of the house. In another second the door opened, and the figure of the faithful Florestan appeared.  \"Florestan,\" said the Count, angrily, \"this is the first time that you have permitted any one to enter this room without my permission; if this occurs again, you leave my service.\"  \"I assure your lordship,\" began the man.  \"Enough! I have spoken; you know what to expect.\"  During this brief colloquy, Mascarin studied the Count with the deepest attention.  The Count Octave de Mussidan in no way resembled the man sketched by Florestan. Since the time of Montaigne, a servant's portrait of his employer should always be distrusted. The Count looked fully sixty, though he was but fifty years of age; he was undersized, and he looked shrunk and shrivelled; he was nearly bald, and his long whiskers were perfectly white. The cares of life had imprinted deep furrows on his brow, and told too plainly the story of a man who, having drained the chalice of life to the bottom, was now ready to shiver the goblet. As Florestan left the room the Count turned to Mascarin, and in the same glacial tone observed, \"And now, sir, explain this intrusion.\"  Mascarin had often been rebuffed, but never so cruelly as this. His vanity was sorely wounded, for he was vain, as all are who think that they possess some hidden influence, and he felt his temper giving way.  \"Pompous idiot!\" thought he; \"we will see how he looks in a short time;\" but his face did not betray this, and his manner remained cringing and obsequious. \"You have heard my name, my lord, and I am a general business agent.\"  The Count was deceived by the honest accents which long practice had taught Mascarin to use, and he had neither a suspicion nor a presentiment.  \"Ah!\" said he majestically, \"a business agent, are you? I presume you come on behalf of one of my creditors. Well, sir, as I have before told these people, your errand is a futile one. Why do they worry me when I unhesitatingly pay the extravagant interest they are pleased to demand? They know that they are all knaves. They are aware that I am rich, for I have inherited a great fortune, which is certainly without encumbrance; for though I could raise a million to-morrow upon my estates in Poitiers, I have up to this time not chosen to do so.\"  Mascarin had at length so recovered his self-command that he listened to this speech without a word, hoping to gain some information from it.  \"You may tell this,\" continued the Count, \"to those by whom you are employed.\"  \"Excuse me, my lord--\"  \"But what?\"  \"I cannot allow--\"  \"I have nothing more to say; all will be settled as I promised, when I pay my daughter's dowry. You are aware that she will shortly be united to M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"  There was no mistaking the order to go, contained in these words, but Mascarin did not offer to do so, but readjusting his spectacles, remarked in a perfectly calm voice,--  \"It is this marriage that has brought me here.\"  The Count thought that his ears had deceived him. \"What are you saying?\" said he.  \"I say,\" repeated the agent, \"that I am sent to you in connection with this same marriage.\"  Neither the doctor nor Florestan had exaggerated the violence of the Count's temper. Upon hearing his daughter's name and marriage mentioned by this man, his face grew crimson and his eyes gleamed with a lurid fire.  \"Get out of this!\" cried he, angrily.  But this was an order that Mascarin had no intention of obeying.  \"I assure you that what I have to say is of the utmost importance,\" said he.  This speech put the finishing touch to the Count's fury.  \"You won't go, won't you?\" said he; and in spite of the pain that at the moment evidently oppressed him, he stepped to the bell, but was arrested by Mascarin, uttering in a warning voice the words,--  \"Take care; if you ring that bell, you will regret it to the last day of your life.\"  This was too much for the Count's patience, and letting go the bell rope, he snatched up a walking cane that was leaning against the chimneypiece, and made a rush toward his visitor. But Mascarin did not move or lift his hand in self-defence, contenting himself with saying calmly,--  \"No violence, Count; remember Montlouis.\"  At this name the Count grew livid, and dropping the cane from his nerveless hand staggered back a pace or two. Had a spectre suddenly stood up before him with threatening hand, he could not have been more horrified.  \"Montlouis!\" he murmured; \"Montlouis!\"  But now Mascarin, thoroughly assured of the value of his weapon, had resumed all his humbleness of demeanor.  \"Believe me, my lord,\" said he, \"that I only mentioned this name on account of the immediate danger that threatens you.\"  The Count hardly seemed to pay attention to his visitor's words.  \"It was not I,\" continued Mascarin, \"who devised the project of bringing against you an act which was perhaps a mere accident. I am only a plenipotentiary from persons I despise, to you, for whom I entertain the very highest respect.\"  By this time the Count had somewhat recovered himself.  \"I really do not understand you,\" said he, in a tone he vainly endeavored to render calm. \"My sudden emotion is only too easily explained. I had a sad misfortune. I accidentally shot my secretary, and the poor young man bore the name you just now mentioned; but the court acquitted me of all blame in the matter.\"  The smile upon Mascarin's face was so full of sarcasm that the Count broke off.  \"Those who sent me here,\" remarked the agent, slowly, \"are well acquainted with the evidence produced in court; but unfortunately, they know the real facts, which certain honorable gentlemen had sense to conceal at any risk.\"  Again the Count started, but Mascarin went on implacably,--  \"But reassure yourself, your friend did not betray you voluntarily. Providence, in her inscrutable decrees----\"  The Count shuddered.  \"In short, sir, in short----\"  Up to this time Mascarin had remained standing, but now that he saw that his position was fully established, he drew up a chair and sat down. The Count grew more livid at this insolent act, but made no comment, and this entirely removed any doubts from the agent's mind.  \"The event to which I have alluded has two eye-witnesses, the Baron de Clinchain, and a servant, named Ludovic Trofin, now in the employ of the Count du Commarin.\"  \"I did not know what had become of Trofin.\"  \"Perhaps not, but my people do. When he swore to keep the matter secret, he was unmarried, but a few years later, having entered the bonds of matrimony, he told all to his young wife. This woman turned out badly; she had several lovers, and through one of them the matter came to my employer's ears.\"  \"And it was on the word of a lackey, and the gossip of a dissolute woman, that they have dared to accuse me.\"  No word of direct accusation had passed, and yet the Count sought to defend himself.  Mascarin saw all this, and smiled inwardly, as he replied, \"We have other evidence than that of Ludovic.\"  \"But,\" said the Count, who was sure of the fidelity of his friend, \"you do not, I suppose, pretend that the Baron de Clinchain has deceived me?\"  The state of mental anxiety and perturbation into which this man of the world had been thrown must have been very intense for him not to have perceived that every word he uttered put a fresh weapon in his adversary's hands.  \"He has not denounced you by word of mouth,\" replied the agent. \"He has done far more; he has written his testimony.\"  \"It is a lie,\" exclaimed the Count.  Mascarin was not disturbed by this insult.  \"The Baron has written,\" repeated he, \"though he never thought that any eye save his own would read what he had penned. As you are aware, the Baron de Clinchain is a most methodical man, and punctilious to a degree.\"  \"I allow that; continue.\"  \"Consequently you will not be surprised to learn that from his earliest years he has kept a diary, and each day he puts down in the most minute manner everything that has occurred, even to the different conditions of his bodily health.\"  The Count knew of his friend's foible, and remembered that when they were young many a practical joke had been played upon his friend on this account, and now he began to perceive the dangerous ground upon which he stood.  \"On hearing the facts of the case from Ludovic's wife's lover,\" continued Mascarin, \"my employers decided that if the tale was a true one, some mention of it would be found in the Baron's diary; and thanks to the ingenuity and skill of certain parties, they have had in their possession for twenty-four hours the volume for the year 1842.\"  \"Scoundrels!\" muttered the Count.  \"They find not only one, but three distinct statements relating to the affair in question.\"  The Count started again to his feet with so menacing a look, that the worthy Mascarin pushed back his chair in anticipation of an immediate assault.  \"Proofs!\" gasped the Count. \"Give me proofs.\"  \"Everything has been provided for, and the three leaves by which you are so deeply compromised have been cut from the book.\"  \"Where are these pages?\"  Mascarin at once put on an air of injured innocence.  \"I have not seen them, but the leaves have been photographed, and a print has been entrusted to me, in order to enable you to recognize the writing.\"  As he spoke he produced three specimens of the photographic art, wonderfully clear and full of fidelity. The Count examined them with the utmost attention, and then in a voice which trembled with emotion, he said, \"True enough, it is his handwriting.\"  Not a line upon Mascarin's face indicated the delight with which he received this admission.  \"Before continuing the subject,\" he observed placidly, \"I consider it necessary for you to understand the position taken up by the Baron de Clinchain. Do you wish, my lord, to read these extracts, or shall I do so for you?\"  \"Read,\" answered the Count, adding in a lower voice, \"I cannot see to do so.\"  Mascarin drew his chair nearer to the lights on the table. \"I perceive,\" said he, \"that the first entry was made on the evening after the--well, the accident. This is it: 'October 26, 1842. Early this morning went out shooting with Octave de Mussidan. We were accompanied by Ludovic, a groom, and by a young man named Montlouis, whom Octave intends one day to make his steward. It was a splendid day, and by twelve o'clock I had killed a leash of hares. Octave was in excellent spirits, and by one o'clock we were in a thick cover not far from Bevron. I and Ludovic were a few yards in front of the others, when angry voices behind attracted our attention. Octave and Montlouis were arguing violently, and all at once the Count struck his future steward a violent blow. In another moment Montlouis came up to me. 'What is the matter?' cried I. Instead of replying to my question, the unhappy young man turned back to his master, uttering a series of threats. Octave had evidently been reproaching him for some low intrigue he had been engaged in, and was reflecting upon the character of the woman. 'At any rate,' cried Montlouis, 'she is quite as virtuous as Madame de Mussidan was before her marriage.'\"  \"'As Octave heard these words, he raised the loaded gun he held in his hand and fired. Montlouis fell to the ground, bathed in blood. We all ran up to him, but he was quite dead, for the charge of shot had penetrated his heart. I was almost beside myself, but Octave's despair was terrible to witness. Tearing his hair, he knelt beside the dead man. Ludovic, however, maintained his calmness. \"We must say that it was an accident,\" observed he quickly. \"Thinking that Montlouis was not near, my master fired into cover.\"  \"'This was agreed to, and we carefully arranged what we should say. It was I who went before the magistrate and made a deposition, which was unhesitatingly received. But, oh, what a fearful day! My pulse is at eighty, and I feel I shall not sleep all night. Octave is half mad, and Heaven knows what will become of him.'\"  The Count, from the depths of his armchair, listened without apparent emotion to this terrible revelation. He was quite crushed, and was searching for some means to exorcise the green spectre of the past, which had so suddenly confronted him. Mascarin never took his eyes off him. All at once the Count roused himself from his prostration, as a man awakes from a hideous dream. \"This is sheer folly,\" cried he.  \"It is folly,\" answered Mascarin, \"that would carry much weight with it.\"  \"And suppose I were to show you,\" returned the Count, \"that all these entries are the offspring of a diseased mind?\"  Mascarin shook his head with an air of affected grief. \"There is no use, my lord, in indulging in vain hopes. We,\" he continued, wishing to associate himself with the Count, \"we might of course admit that the Baron de Clinchain had made this entry in his diary in a moment of temporary insanity, were it not for the painful fact that there were others. Le me read them.\"  \"Go on; I am all attention.\"  \"We find the following, three days later: 'Oct. 29th, 1842. I am most uneasy about my health. I feel shooting pains in all my joints. The derangement of my system arises entirely from this business of Octave's. I had to run the gauntlet of a second court, and the judge's eyes seemed to look me through and through. I also saw with much alarm that my second statement differs somewhat from the first one, so I have now learned it by heart. Ludovic is a sharp fellow, and quite self-possessed. I would like to have him in my household. I keep myself shut up in my house for fear of meeting friends who want to hear all the details of the accident. I believe I may say that I have repeated the story more than a couple of dozen times.' Now, my lord,\" added Mascarin, \"what do you say to this?\"  \"Continue the reading of the extracts.\"  \"The third allusion, though it is short, is still very important: 'November 3rd, 1842. Thank Heaven! all is over. I have just returned from the court. Octave has been acquitted. Ludovic had behaved wonderfully. He explained the reason of the misadventure in a way that was really surprising in an uneducated man, and there was not an atom of suspicion among judge, jury, or spectators. I have changed my mind; I would not have a fellow like Ludovic in my service; he is much too sharp. When I had been duly sworn, I gave my evidence. Though I was much agitated, I went through it all right; but when I got home I felt very ill, and discovered that my pulse was down to fifty. Ah, me! what terrible misfortunes are wrought by a momentary burst of anger. I now write this sentence in my diary: _\"Never give way to first impulses.\"_' These words,\" continued Mascarin, \"were inscribed on every one of the pages following,--at least so those who examined the entries informed me.\"  Mascarin persisted in representing himself as the agent of others, but still the Count made no allusion to the persons in the background.  After a few moments the Count rose and limped up and down, as though he hoped by this means to collect his ideas, or perhaps in order to prevent his visitor from scanning his face too closely.  \"Have you done?\" asked he, all at once.  \"Yes, my lord.\"  \"Have you thought what an impartial judge would say?\"  \"I think I have.\"  \"He would say,\" broke in the Count, \"that no sane man would have written such things down, for there are certain secrets which we do not whisper even to ourselves, and it is hardly likely that any man would make such compromising entries in a diary which might be lost or stolen, and which would certainly be read by his heir. Do you think that a man of high position would record his perjury, which is a crime that would send him to penal servitude?\"  Mascarin gazed upon the Count with an air of pity.  \"You are not going the right way, my lord, to get out of your trouble. No lawyer would adopt your theory. If the remaining volumes of M. de Clinchain's diaries were produced in court, I imagine that other equally startling entries would be found in them.\"  The Count now appeared to have arrived at some decision, and to continue the conversation simply for the purpose of gaining time.  \"Well,\" said he, \"I will give up this idea; but how do I know that these documents are not forgeries? Nowadays, handwritings are easily facsimilied, when even bankers find it hard to distinguish between their own notes and counterfeit ones.\"  \"That can be settled by seeing if certain leaves are missing from the Baron's diary.\"  \"That does not prove much.\"  \"Pardon me, it proves a great deal. This new line of argument, I assure you, will avail you as little as the other. I am perfectly aware that the Baron de Clinchain will utter whatever words you may place in his mouth. Let us suppose that the leaves which have been torn out should fit into the book exactly. Would not that be a strong point?\"  The Count smiled ironically, as though he had a crushing reply in reserve.  \"And so this is your opinion, is it?\" said he.  \"It is indeed.\"  \"Then all I have to do is to plead guilty. I did kill Montlouis, just as Clinchain describes, but----\" and as he spoke he took a heavy volume from a shelf, and opening it at a certain place laid it before Mascarin, remarking,--\"this is the criminal code; read. 'All proceedings in criminal law shall be cancelled after a lapse of ten years.'\"  The Count de Mussidan evidently thought that he had crushed his adversary by this shattering blow; but it was not so, for instead of exhibiting any surprise, Mascarin's smile was as bland as ever.  \"I, too, know a little of the law,\" said he. \"The very first day this matter was brought to me, I turned to this page and read what you have just shown me to my employers.\"  \"And what did they say?\"  \"That they knew all this, but that you would be glad to compromise the affair, even at the expense of half your fortune.\"  The agent's manner was so confident that the Count felt they had discovered some means of turning this crime of his early days to advantage; but he was still sufficiently master of himself to show no emotion.  \"No,\" replied he, \"it is not such an easy matter as you think to get hold of half my fortune. I fancy that your friends' demands will assume a more modest tone, the more so when I repeat that these morsels of paper, stolen from my friend's diary, are absolutely worthless.\"  \"Do you think so?\"  \"Certainly, for the law on this matter speaks plainly enough.\"  Mascarin readjusted his glasses, a sure indication that he was going to make an important reply.  \"You are quite right, my lord,\" said he, slowly. \"There is no intention of taking you before any court, for there is no penalty now for a crime committed twenty-three years ago; but the miserable wretches whom I blush to act for have arranged a plan which will be disagreeable in the highest degree both for you and the Baron.\"  \"Pray tell me what this clever plan is.\"  \"Most certainly. I came here to-day for this very purpose. Let us first conclude that you have rejected the request with which I approached you.\"  \"Do you call this style of thing a request?\"  \"What is the use of quarrelling over words. Well, to-morrow, my clients--though I am ashamed to speak of them as such--will send to a well known morning paper a tale, with the title, 'Story of a Day's Shooting.' Of course only initials will be used for the names, but no doubt will exist as to the identity of the actors in the tragedy.\"  \"You forget that in actions for libel proofs are not admitted.\"  Mascarin shrugged his shoulders.  \"My employers forget nothing,\" remarked he; \"and it is upon this very point that they have based their plans For this reason they introduce into the matter a fifth party, of course an accomplice, whose name is introduced into the story in the paper. Upon the day of its appearance, this man lodges a complaint against the journal, and insists on proving in a court of justice, that he did not form one of the shooting-party.\"  \"Well, what happens then?\"  \"Then, my lord, this man insists that the journal should give a retraction of the injurious statement and summons as witnesses both yourself and the Baron de Clinchain, and as a conclusion, Ludovic; and as he claims damages, he employs a lawyer, who is one of the confederates and behind the scenes. The lawyer will speak something to this effect: 'That the Count de Mussidan is clearly a murderer; that the Baron de Clinchain is a perjurer, as proved by his own handwriting; Ludovic has been tampered with, but my client, an honorable man, must not be classed with these, etc., etc.' Have I made myself understood?\"  Indeed, he had, and with such cold and merciless logic that it seemed hopeless to expect to escape from the net that had been spread.  As these thoughts passed through the Count's brain, he saw at a glance the whole terrible notoriety that the case would cause, and society gloating over the details. Yet such was the obstinacy of his disposition, and so impatient was he of control, that the more desperate his position seemed, the fiercer was his resistance. He knew the world well, and he also knew that the cutthroats who demanded his money with threats had every reason to dread the lynx eye of the law. If he refused to listen to them, as his heart urged him, perhaps they would not dare to carry out their threats. Had he alone been concerned in the matter, he would have resisted to the last, and fought it out to the last drop of his blood, and as a preliminary, would have beaten the sneering rogue before him to a jelly; but how dared he expose his friend Clinchain, who had already braved so much for him? As he paced up and down the library, these and many other thoughts swept across his brain, and he was undecided whether to submit to these extortions or throw the agent out of the window. His excited demeanor and the occasional interjections that burst from his lips showed Mascarin that the account of him was not exaggerated, and that when led by passion he would as soon shoot a fellow-creature as a rabbit. And yet, though he knew not whether he should make his exit by the door or the window, he sat twirling his fingers with the most unconcerned air imaginable. At last the Count gave ear to prudence. He stopped in front of the agent, and, taking no pains to hide his contempt, said,--  \"Come, let us make an end of this. How much do you want for these papers?\"  \"Oh, my lord!\" exclaimed Mascarin; \"surely you do not think that I could be guilty----?\"  M. de Mussidan shrugged his shoulders. \"Pray, do not take me for a fool,\" said he, \"but name your sum.\"  Mascarin seemed a little embarrassed, and hesitated. \"We don't want money,\" answered he at length.  \"Not money!\" replied the Count.  \"We want something that is of no importance to you, but of the utmost value to those who despatched me here. I am commissioned to inform you that my clients desire that you should break off the engagement between your daughter and M. de Breulh-Faverlay, and that the missing paper will be handed to you on the completion of her marriage with any else whom you may deem worthy of such an honor.\"  This demand, which was utterly unexpected, so astonished the Count that he could only exclaim, \"Why, this is absolute madness!\"  \"No; it is plain, good sense, and a _bona fide_ offer.\"  An idea suddenly flashed across the Count's mind. \"Is it your intention,\" asked he, \"to furnish me with a son-in-law too?\"  \"I am sure, my lord,\" answered Mascarin, looking the picture of disinterested honesty, \"that, even to save yourself, you would never sacrifice your daughter.\"  \"But--\"  \"You are entirely mistaken; it is M. de Breulh-Faverlay whom my clients wish to strike at, for they have taken an oath that he shall never wed a lady with a million for her dowry.\"  So surprised was the Count, that the whole aspect of the interview seemed to have changed, and he now combated his own objections instead of those of his unwelcome visitor. \"M. de Breulh-Faverlay has my promise,\" remarked he; \"but of course it is easy to find a pretext. The Countess, however, is in favor of the match, and the chief opposition to any change will come from her.\"  Mascarin did not think it wise to make any reply, and the Count continued, \"My daughter also may not view this rupture with satisfaction.\"  Thanks to the information he had received from Florestan, Mascarin knew how much importance to attach to this. \"Mademoiselle, at her age and with her tastes, is not likely to have her heart seriously engaged.\" For fully a quarter of an hour the Count still hesitated. He knew that he was entirely at the mercy of those miscreants, and his pride revolted at the idea of submission; but at length he yielded.  \"I agree,\" said he. \"My daughter shall not marry M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"  Even in his hour of triumph, Mascarin's face did not change. He bowed profoundly, and left the room; but as he descended the stairs, he rubbed his hands, exclaiming, \"If the doctor has made as good a job of it as I have, success is certain.\"    CHAPTER VI.  A MEDICAL ADVISER.  Doctor Hortebise did not find it necessary to resort to any of those expedients which Mascarin had found it advisable to use in order to reach Madame de Mussidan. As soon as he presented himself--that is, after a brief interval of five minutes--he was introduced into the presence of the Countess. He rather wondered at this, for Madame de Mussidan was one of those restless spirits that are seldom found at home, but are to be met with at exhibitions, on race-courses, at the _salons_, restaurants, shops, or theatres; or at the studio of some famous artist; or at the rooms of some musical professor who had discovered a new tenor; anywhere and everywhere, in fact, except at home. Hers was one of those restless natures constantly craving for excitement; and husband, home, and child were mere secondary objects in her eyes. She had many avocations; she was a patroness of half a dozen charitable institutions, but the chief thing that she did was to spend money. Gold seemed to melt in her grasp like so much snow, and she never knew what became of the sums she lavished so profusely. Husband and wife had long been almost totally estranged, and led almost separate existences. Dr. Hortebise was well aware of this, in common with others who moved in society. Upon the appearance of the doctor, the Countess dropped the book she had been perusing, and gave vent to an exclamation of delight. \"Ah, doctor, this is really very kind of you;\" and at the same time signed to the servant to place a chair for the visitor.  The Countess was tall and slender, and at forty-five had the figure of a girl. She had an abundance of fair hair, the color of which concealed the silver threads which plentifully interspersed it. A subtle perfume hung about her, and her pale blue eyes were full of pride and cold disdain.  \"You know how to time your visits so well, doctor!\" said she. \"I am thoroughly bored, and am utterly weary of books, for it always seems to me, when I read, that I had perused the same thing before somewhere or other. You have arrived at so opportune a moment, that you appear to be a favorite of timely chance.\"  The doctor was indeed a favorite of chance; but the name of the chance was Baptiste Mascarin.  \"I see so few visitors,\" continued Madame de Mussidan, \"that hardly any one comes to see me. I must really set aside one day in the week for my at home; for when I do happen to stay at home, I feel fearfully dull and lonely. For two mortal hours I have been in this room. I have been nursing the Count.\"  The doctor knew better than this; but he smiled pleasantly, and said, \"Perfectly so,\" exactly at the right moment.  \"Yes,\" continued the Countess, \"my husband slipped on the stairs, and hurt himself very much. Our doctor says it is nothing; but then I put little faith in what doctors say.\"  \"I know that by experience, madame,\" replied Hortebise.  \"Present company of course always excepted; but, do you know, I once really believed in you; but your sudden conversion to homeopathy quite frightened me.\"  The doctor smiled. \"It is as safe a mode of practice as any other.\"  \"Do you really think so?\"  \"I am perfectly sure of it.\"  \"Well, now that you _are_ here, I am half inclined to ask your advice.\"  \"I trust that you are not suffering.\"  \"No, thank heaven; I have never any cause to complain of my health; but I am very anxious about Sabine's state.\"  Her affection of maternal solicitude was a charming pendant to her display of conjugal affection, and again the doctor's expression of assent came in in the right place.  \"Yes, for a month, doctor, I have hardly seen Sabine, I have been so much engaged; but yesterday I met her, and was quite shocked at the change in her appearance.\"  \"Did you ask her what ailed her?\"  \"Of course, and she said, 'Nothing,' adding that she was perfectly well.\"  \"Perhaps something had vexed her?\"  \"She,--why, don't you know that every one likes her, and that she is one of the happiest girls in Paris; but I want you to see her in spite of that.\" She rang the bell as she spoke, and as soon as the footman made his appearance, said, \"Lubin, ask Mademoiselle to have the goodness to step downstairs.\"  \"Mademoiselle has gone out, madame.\"  \"Indeed! how long ago?\"  \"About three o'clock, madame.\"  \"Who went with her?\"  \"Her maid, Modeste.\"  \"Did Mademoiselle say where she was going to?\"  \"No, madame.\"  \"Very well, you can go.\"  Even the imperturbable doctor was rather surprised at a girl of eighteen being permitted so much freedom.  \"It is most annoying,\" said the Countess. \"However, let us hope that the trifling indisposition, regarding which I wished to consult you, will not prevent her marriage.\"  Here was the opening that Hortebise desired.  \"Is Mademoiselle going to be married?\" asked he with an air of respectful curiosity.  \"Hush!\" replied Madame de Mussidan, placing her finger on her lips; \"this is a profound secret, and there is nothing definitely arranged; but you, as a doctor, are a perfect father confessor, and I feel that I can trust you. Let me whisper to you that it is quite possible that Sabine will be Madame de Breulh-Faverlay before the close of the year.\"  Hortebise had not Mascarin's courage; indeed, he was frequently terrified at his confederate's projects; but having once given in his adherence, he was to be relied on, and did not hesitate for a moment. \"I confess, madame, that I heard that mentioned before;\" returned he cautiously.  \"And, pray, who was your informant?\"  \"Oh, I have had it from many sources; and let me say at once that it was this marriage, and no mere chance, that brought me here to-day.\"  Madame de Mussidan liked the doctor and his pleasant and witty conversation very much, and was always charmed to see him; but it was intolerable that he should venture to interfere in her daughter's marriage. \"Really, sir, you confer a great honor upon the Count and myself,\" answered she haughtily.  Her severe manner, however, did not cause the doctor to lose his temper. He had come to say certain things in a certain manner. He had learned his part, and nothing that the Countess could say would prevent his playing it.  \"I assure you, madame,\" returned he, \"that when I accepted the mission with which I am charged, I only did so from my feelings of respect to you and yours.\"  \"You are really very kind,\" answered the Countess superciliously.  \"And I am sure, madame, that after you have heard what I have to say, you will have even more reason to agree with me.\" His manner as he said this was so peculiar, that the Countess started as though she had received a galvanic shock. \"For more than twenty-five years,\" pursued the doctor, \"I have been the constant depository of strange family secrets, and some of them have been very terrible ones. I have often found myself in a very delicate position, but never in such an embarrassing one as I am now.\"  \"You alarm me,\" said the Countess, dropping her impatient manner.  \"If, madame, what I have come to relate to you are the mere ravings of a lunatic, I will offer my most sincere apologies; but if, on the contrary, his statements are true--and he has irrefragable proofs in his possession,--then, madame----\"  \"What then, doctor?\"  \"Then, madame, I can only say, make every use of me, for I will willingly place my life at your disposal.\"  The Countess uttered a laugh as artificial as the tears of long-expectant heirs. \"Really,\" said she, \"your solemn air and tones almost kill me with laughter.\"  \"She laughs too heartily, and at the wrong time. Mascarin is right,\" thought the doctor. \"I trust, madame,\" continued he, \"that I too may laugh at my own imaginary fears; but whatever may be the result, permit me to remind you that a little time back you said that a doctor was a father confessor; for, like a priest, the physician only hears secrets in order to forget them. He is also more fitted to console and advise, for, as his profession brings him into contact with the frailties and passions of the world, he can comprehend and excuse.\"  \"And you must not forget, doctor, that like the priest also, he preaches very long sermons.\"  As she uttered this sarcasm, there was a jesting look upon her features, but it elicited no smile from Hortebise, who, as he proceeded, grew more grave.  \"I may be foolish,\" he said; \"but I had better be that than reopen some old wound.\"  \"Do not be afraid, doctor; speak out.\"  \"Then, I will begin by asking if you have any remembrance of a young man in your own sphere of society, who, at the time of your marriage, was well known in every Parisian _salon_. I speak of the Marquis de Croisenois.\"  The Countess leaned back in her chair, and contracted her brow, and pursed up her lips, as though vainly endeavoring to remember the name.  \"The Marquis de Croisenois?\" repeated she. \"It seems as if----no--wait a moment. No; I cannot say that I can call any such person to mind.\"  The doctor felt that he must give the spur to this rebellious memory.  \"Yes, Croisenois,\" he repeated. \"His Christian name was George, and he had a brother Henry, whom you certainly must know, for this winter I saw him at the Duchess de Laumeuse's, dancing with your daughter.\"  \"You are right; I remember the name now.\"  Her manner was indifferent and careless as she said this.  \"Then perhaps you also recollect that some twenty-three years ago, George de Croisenois vanished suddenly. This disappearance caused a terrible commotion at the time, and was one of the chief topics of society.\"  \"Ah! indeed?\" mused the Countess.  \"He was last seen at the Café de Paris, where he dined with some friends. About nine he got up to leave. One of his friends proposed to go with him, but he begged him not to do so, saying, 'Perhaps I shall see you later on at the opera, but do not count on me.' The general impression was that he was going to some love tryst.\"  \"His friends thought that, I suppose.\"  \"Yes, for he was attired with more care than usual, though he was always one of the best dressed men in Paris. He went out alone, and was never seen again.\"  \"Never again,\" repeated the Countess, a slight shade passing across her brow.  \"Never again,\" echoed the unmoved doctor. \"At first his friends merely thought his absence strange; but at the end of a week they grew anxious.\"  \"You go very much into details.\"  \"I heard them all at the time, madame, and they were only brought back to my memory this morning. All are to be found in the records of a minute search that the authorities caused to be made into the affair. The friends of De Croisenois had commenced the search; but when they found their efforts useless, they called in the aid of the police. The first idea was suicide: George might have gone into some lonely spot and blown out his brains. There was no reason for this; he had ample means, and always appeared contented and happy. Then it was believed that a murder had been committed, and fresh inquiries were instituted, but nothing could be discovered--nothing.\"  The Countess affected to stifle a yawn, and repeated like an echo, \"Nothing.\"  \"Three months later, when the police had given up the matter in despair, one of George de Croisenois' friends received a letter from him.\"  \"He was not dead then, after all?\"  Dr. Hortebise made a mental note of the tone and manner of the Countess, to consider over at his leisure.  \"Who can say?\" returned he. \"The envelope bore the Cairo post-mark. In it George declared that, bored with Parisian life, he was going to start on an exploring expedition to Central Africa, and that no one need be anxious about him. People thought this letter highly suspicious. A man does not start upon such an expedition as this without money; and it was conclusively proved that on the day of De Croisenois' disappearance he had not more than a thousand francs about him, half of which was in Spanish doubloons, won at whist before dinner. The letter was therefore regarded as a trick to turn the police off the scent; but the best experts asserted that the handwriting was George's own. Two detectives were at once despatched to Cairo, but neither there nor anywhere on the road were any traces of the missing man discovered.\"  As the doctor spoke, he kept his eyes riveted on the Countess, but her face was impassable.  \"Is that all?\" asked she.  Dr. Hortebise paused a few moments before he replied, and then answered slowly,--  \"A man came to me yesterday, and asserts that you can tell me what has become of George de Croisenois.\"  A man could not have displayed the nerve evinced by this frail and tender woman, for however callous he may be, some feature will betray the torture he is enduring; but a woman can often turn a smiling face upon the person who is racking her very soul. At the mere name of Montlouis the Count had staggered, as though crushed down by a blow from a sledge hammer; but at this accusation of Hortebise the Countess burst into a peal of laughter, apparently perfectly frank and natural, which utterly prevented her from replying.  \"My dear doctor,\" said she at length, as soon as she could manage to speak, \"your tale is highly sensational and amusing, but I really think that you ought to consult a _clairvoyant_, and not a matter-of-fact person like me, about the fate of George de Croisenois.\"  But the doctor, who was ready with his retort, and, not at all disconcerted by the cachinations of the Countess, heaved a deep sigh, as though a great load had been removed from his heart, and, with an air of extreme delight, exclaimed, \"Thank Heaven! then I was deceived.\"  He uttered these words with an affectation of such sincerity that the Countess fell into the trap.  \"Come,\" said she, with a winning smile, \"tell me who it is that says I know so much.\"  \"Pooh! pooh!\" returned Hortebise. \"What good would that do? He has made a fool of me, and caused me to risk losing your good opinion. Is not that enough? To-morrow, when he comes to my house, my servants will refuse to admit him; but if I were to do as my inclinations lead me, I should hand him over to the police.\"  \"That would never do,\" returned the Countess, \"for that would change a mere nothing into a matter of importance. Tell me the name of your mysterious informer. Do I know him?\"  \"It is impossible that you could do so, madame, for he is far below you in the social grade. You would learn nothing from his name. He is a man I once helped, and is called Daddy Tantaine.\"  \"A mere nickname, of course.\"  \"He is miserably poor, a cynic, philosopher, but as sharp as a needle; and this last fact causes me great uneasiness, for at first I thought that he had been sent to me by some one far above him in position, but--\"  \"But, doctor,\" interposed the Countess, \"you spoke to me of proofs, of threats, of certain mysterious persons.\"  \"I simply repeated Daddy Tantaine's words. The old idiot said to me, 'Madame de Mussidan knows all about the fate of the Marquis, and this is clearly proved by letters that she has received from him, as well as from the Duke de Champdoce.'\"  This time the arrow went home. She grew deadly pale, and started to her feet with her eyes dilated with horror.  \"My letters!\" exclaimed she hoarsely.  Hortebise appeared utterly overwhelmed by this display of consternation, of which he was the innocent cause.  \"Your letters, madame,\" replied he with evident hesitation, \"this double-dyed scoundrel declares he has in his possession.\"  With a cry like that of a wounded lioness, the Countess, taking no notice of the doctor's presence, rushed from the room. Her rapid footfall could be heard on the stairs, and the rustle of her silken skirts against the banisters. As soon as he was left alone, the doctor rose from his seat with a cynical smile upon his face.  \"You may search,\" mused he, \"but you will find that the birds have flown.\" He walked up to one of the windows, and drummed on the glass with his fingers. \"People say,\" remarked he, \"that Mascarin never makes a mistake. One cannot help admiring his diabolical sagacity and unfailing logic. From the most trivial event he forges a long chain of evidence, as the botanist is able, as he picks up a withered leaf, to describe in detail the tree it came from. A pity, almost, that he did not turn his talents to some nobler end; but no; he is now upstairs putting the Count on the rack, while I am inflicting tortures on the Countess. What a shameful business we are carrying on! There are moments when I think that I have paid dearly for my life of luxury, for I know well,\" he added, half consciously fingering his locket, \"that some day we shall meet some one stronger than ourselves, and then the inevitable will ensue.\"  The reappearance of the Countess broke the chain of his thoughts. Her hair was disturbed, her eyes had a wild look in them, and everything about her betrayed the state of agitation she was in.  \"Robbed! robbed!\" cried she, as she entered the room. Her excitement was so extreme that she spoke aloud, forgetting that the door was open, and that the lackey in the ante-room could hear all she said. Luckily Hortebise did not lose his presence of mind, and, with the ease of a leading actor repairing the error of a subordinate, he closed the door.  \"What have you lost?\" asked he.  \"My letters; they are all gone.\"  She staggered on to a couch, and in broken accents went on. \"And yet these letters were in an iron casket closed by a secret spring; that casket was in a drawer, the key of which never leaves me.\"  \"Good heavens!\" exclaimed Hortebise in affected tones, \"then Tantaine spoke the truth.\"  \"He did,\" answered the Countess hoarsely. \"Yes,\" she continued, \"I am the bondslave to people whose names I do not even know, who can control my every movement and action.\"  She hid her face in her hands as though her pride sought to conceal her despair.  \"Are these letters, then, so terribly compromising?\" asked the doctor.  \"I am utterly lost,\" cried she. \"In my younger days I had no experience; I only thought of vengeance, and lately the weapons I forged myself have been turned against me. I dug a pitfall for my adversaries and have fallen into it myself.\"  Hortebise did not attempt to stay the torrent of her words, for the Countess was in one of those moods of utter despair when the inner feelings of the soul are made manifest, as during a violent tempest the weeds of ocean are hurled up to the surface of the troubled waters.  \"I would sooner be lying in my grave a thousand times,\" wailed she, \"than see these letters in my husband's hands. Poor Octave! have I not caused him sufficient annoyance already without this crowning sorrow? Well, Dr. Hortebise, I am menaced with the production of these letters, and they will be handed to my husband unless I agree to certain terms. What are they? Of course money is required; tell me to what amount.\"  The doctor shook his head.  \"Not money?\" cried the Countess; \"what, then, do they require? Speak, and do not torture me more.\"  Sometimes Hortebise confessed to Mascarin that, putting his interests on one side, he pitied his victims; but he showed no sign of this feeling, and went on,--  \"The value of what they require, madame, is best estimated by yourself.\"  \"Tell me what it is; I can bear anything now.\"  \"These compromising letters will be placed in your hands upon the day on which your daughter marries Henry de Croisenois, the brother of George.\"  Madame de Mussidan's astonishment was so great that she stood as though petrified into a statue.  \"I am commissioned to inform you, madame, that every delay necessary for altering any arrangements that may exist will be accorded you; but, remember, if your daughter marries any one else than Henry de Croisenois, the letters will be at once placed in your husband's hands.\"  As he spoke the doctor watched her narrowly. The Countess crossed the room, faint and dizzy, and rested her head on the mantelpiece.  \"And that is all?\" asked she. \"What you ask me to do is utterly impossible: and perhaps it is for the best, for I shall have no long agony of suspense to endure. Go, doctor, and tell the villain who holds my letters that he can take them to the Count at once.\"  The Countess spoke in such a decided tone that Hortebise was a little puzzled.  \"Can it be true,\" she continued, \"that scoundrels exist in our country who are viler than the most cowardly murderers,--men who trade in the shameful secrets that they have learned, and batten upon the money they earn by their odious trade? I heard of such creatures before, but declined to believe it; for I said to myself that such an idea only existed in the unhealthy imaginations of novel writers. It seems, however that I was in error; but do not let these villains rejoice too soon; they will reap but a scanty harvest. There is one asylum left for me where they cannot molest me.\"  \"Ah, madame!\" exclaimed the doctor in imploring accents; but she paid no attention to his remonstrances, and went on with increasing violence,--  \"Do the miserable wretches think that I fear death? For years I have prayed for it as a final mercy from the heaven I have so deeply offended. I long for the quiet of the sepulchre. You are surprised at hearing one like me speak in this way,--one who has all her life been admired and flattered,--I, Diana de Laurebourg, Countess de Mussidan. Even in the hours of my greatest triumphs my soul shuddered at the thought of the grim spectre hidden away in the past; and I wished that death would come and relieve my sufferings. My eccentricities have often surprised my friends, who asked if sometimes I were not a little mad. Mad? Yes, I am mad! They do not know that I seek oblivion in excitement, and that I dare not be alone. But I have learned by this time that I must stifle the voice of conscience.\"  She spoke like a woman utterly bereft of hope, who had resolved on the final sacrifice. Her clear voice rang through the room, and Hortebise turned pale as he heard the footsteps of the servants pacing to and fro outside the door, as they made preparations for dinner.  \"All my life has been one continual struggle,\" resumed she,--\"a struggle which has cost me sore; but now all is over, and to-night, for the first time for many years, Diana de Mussidan will sleep a calm and untroubled sleep.\"  The excitement of the Countess had risen to so high a pitch that the doctor asked himself how he could allay a tempest which he had not foreseen; for her loud tones would certainly alarm the servants, who would hasten to acquaint the Count, who was himself stretched upon the rack; then the entire plot would be laid bare, and all would be lost.  Madame de Mussidan was about to rush from the room, when the doctor, perceiving that he must act decisively, seized her by both wrists, and, almost by force, caused her to resume her seat.  \"In Heaven's name, madame,\" he whispered, \"for your daughter's sake, listen to me. Do not throw up all; am not I here ready to do your bidding, whatever it may be? Rely upon me,--rely upon the knowledge of a man of the world, and of one who still possesses some portion of what is called a heart. Cannot we form an alliance to ward off this attack?\"  The doctor continued in this strain, endeavoring to reassure the Countess as much as he had previously endeavored to terrify her, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing his efforts crowned with success; for Madame de Mussidan listened to his flow of language, hardly comprehending its import, but feeling calmer as he went on; and in a quarter of an hour he had persuaded her to look the situation boldly in the face. Then Hortebise breathed more freely, and, wiping the perspiration from his brow, felt that he had gained the victory.  \"It is a nefarious plot,\" said the Countess.  \"So it is, madame; but the facts remain. Only tell me one thing, have you any special objection to M. de Croisenois paying his addresses to your daughter?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"He comes from a good family, is well educated, handsome, popular, and only thirty-four. If you remember, George was his senior by fifteen years. Why, then, is not the marriage a suitable one? Certainly, he has led rather a fast life; but what young man is immaculate? They say that he is deeply in debt; but then your daughter has enough for both. Besides, his brother left him a considerable fortune, not far short of two millions, I believe; and to this, of course Henry will eventually succeed.\"  Madame de Mussidan was too overwhelmed by what she had already gone through to offer any further exposition of her feelings on the subject.  \"All this is very well,\" answered she; \"but the Count has decided that Sabine is to become the wife of M. de Breulh-Faverlay, and I have no voice in the matter.\"  \"But if you exert your influence?\"  The Countess shook her head. \"Once on a time,\" said she sadly, \"I reigned supreme over Octave's heart; I was the leading spirit of his existence. Then he loved me; but I was insensible to the depths of his affection, and wore out a love that would have lasted as long as life itself. Yes, in my folly I slew it, and now----\" She paused for a moment as if to collect her ideas, and then added more slowly: \"and now our lives are separate ones. I do not complain; it is all my own fault; he is just and generous.\"  \"But surely you can make the effort?\"  \"But suppose Sabine loves M. de Breulh-Faverlay?\"  \"But, madame, a mother can always influence her daughter.\"  The Countess seized the doctor's hand, and grasped it so tightly that he could hardly bear the pain.  \"I must,\" said she in a hoarse whisper, \"divulge to you the whole extent of my unhappiness. I am estranged from my husband, and my daughter dislikes and despises me. Some people think that life can be divided into two portions, one consecrated to pleasure and excitement, and the other to domestic peace and happiness; but the idea is a false one. As youth has been, so will be age, either a reward or an expiation.\"  Dr. Hortebise did not care to follow this train of argument--for the Count might enter at any moment, or a servant might come in to announce dinner--and only sought to soothe the excited feelings of Madame de Mussidan, and to prove to her that she was frightened by shadows, and that in reality she was not estranged from her husband, nor did her daughter dislike her; and finally a ray of hope illuminated the saddened heart of the unfortunate lady.  \"Ah, doctor!\" said she, \"it is only misfortune that teaches us to know our true friends.\"  The Countess, like her husband, had now laid down her arms; she had made a longer fight of it, but in both cases the result had been the same. She promised that she would commence operations the next day, and do her utmost to break off the present engagement.  Hortebise then took his leave, quite worn out with the severe conflict he had waged during his two hours' interview with the Countess. In spite of the extreme cold, the air outside seemed to refresh him considerably, and he inhaled it with the happy feeling that he had performed his duty in a manner worthy of all praise. He walked up the Rue de Faubourg Saint Honore, and again entered the _café_ where he and his worthy confederate had agreed to meet. Mascarin was there, an untasted cutlet before him, and his face hidden by a newspaper which his anxiety would not permit him to peruse. His suspense was terrible. Had Hortebise failed? had he encountered one of those unforeseen obstacles which, like a minute grain of sand, utterly hinders the working of a piece of delicate machinery?  \"Well, what news?\" said he eagerly, as soon as he caught sight of the doctor.  \"Success, perfect success!\" said Hortebise gayly. \"But,\" added he, as he sank exhausted upon a seat, \"the battle has been a hard one.\"    CHAPTER VII.  IN THE STUDIO.  Staggering like a drunken man, Paul Violaine descended the stairs when his interview with Mascarin had been concluded. The sudden and unexpected good fortune which had fallen so opportunely at his feet had for the moment absolutely stunned him. He was now removed from a position which had caused him to gaze with longing upon the still waters of the Seine, to one of comparative affluence. \"Mascarin,\" said he to himself, \"has offered me an appointment bringing in twelve thousand francs per annum, and proposed to give me the first month's salary in advance.\"  Certainly it was enough to bewilder any man, and Paul was utterly dazed. He went over all the events that had occurred during the day--the sudden appearance of old Tantaine, with his loan of five hundred francs, and the strange man who knew the whole history of his life, and who, without making any conditions, had offered him a valuable situation. Paul was in no particular hurry to get back to the Hotel de Perou, for he said to himself that Rose could wait. A feeling of restlessness had seized upon him. He wanted to squander money, and to have the sympathy of some companions,--but where should he go, for he had no friends? Searching the records of his memory, he remembered that, when poverty had first overtaken him, he had borrowed twenty francs from a young fellow of his own age, named Andre. Some gold coins still jingled in his pocket, and he could have a thousand francs for the asking. Would it not add to his importance if he were to go and pay this debt? Unluckily his creditor lived a long distance off in the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne. He, however, hailed a passing cab, and was driven to Andre's address. This young man was only a casual acquaintance, whom Paul had picked up one day in a small wine-shop to which he used to take Rose when he first arrived in Paris. Andre, with whose other name Paul was unacquainted, was an artist, and, in addition, was an ornamental sculptor, and executed those wonderful decorations on the outside of houses in which builders delight. The trade is not a pleasant one, for it necessitates working at dizzy heights, on scaffolds that vibrate with every footstep, and exposes you to the heat of summer and the frosts of winter. The business, however, is well paid, and Andre got a good price for his stone figures and wreaths. But all the money he earned went in the study of the painter's art, which was the secret desire of his soul. He had taken a studio, and twice his pictures had been exhibited at the _Salon_, and orders began to come in. Many of his brother artists predicted a glorious future for him. When the cab stopped, Paul threw the fare to the driver, and asked the clean-looking portress, who was polishing the brasswork on the door, if M. Andre was at home.  \"He is, sir,\" replied the old woman, adding, with much volubility, \"and you are likely to find him in, for he has so much work; but he is such a good and quiet young man, and so regular in his habits! I don't believe he owes a penny in the world; and as for drink, why he is a perfect Anchorite. Then he has very few acquaintances,--one young lady, whose face for a month past I have tried to see, but failed, because she wears a veil, comes to see him, accompanied by her maid.\"  \"Good heavens, woman!\" cried Paul impatiently, \"will you tell me where to find M. Andre?\"  \"Fourth floor, first door to the right,\" answered the portress, angry at being interrupted; and as Paul ran up the stairs, she muttered, \"A young chap with no manners, taking the words out of a body's mouth like that! Next time he comes, I'll serve him out somehow.\"  Paul found the door, with a card with the word \"Andre\" marked upon it nailed up, and rapped on the panel. He heard the sound of a piece of furniture being moved, and the jingle of rings being passed along a rod; then a clear, youthful voice answered, \"Come in!\"  Paul entered, and found himself in a large, airy room, lighted by a skylight, and exquisitely clean and orderly. Sketches and drawings were suspended on the walls; there was a handsome carpet from Tunis, and a comfortable lounge; a mirror in a carved frame, which would have gladdened the heart of a connoisseur, stood upon the mantelpiece. An easel with a picture upon it, covered with a green baize curtain, stood in one corner. The young painter was in the centre of his studio, brush and palette in hand. He was a dark, handsome young man, well built and proportioned, with close-cut hair, and a curling beard flowing down over his chest. His face was full of expression, and the energy and vigor imprinted upon it formed a marked contrast to the appearance of Mascarin's _protégé_. Paul noticed that he did not wear the usual painter's blouse, but was carefully dressed in the prevailing fashion. As soon as he recognized Paul, Andre came forward with extended hand. \"Ah,\" said he, \"I am pleased to see you, for I often wondered what had become of you.\"  Paul was offended at this familiar greeting. \"I have had many worries and disappointments,\" said he.  \"And Rose,\" said Andre, \"how is she--as pretty as ever, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" answered Paul negligently; \"but you must forgive me for having vanished so suddenly. I have come to repay your loan, with many thanks.\"  \"Pshaw!\" returned the painter, \"I never thought of the matter again; pray, do not inconvenience yourself.\"  Again Paul felt annoyed, for he fancied that under the cloak of assumed generosity the painter meant to humiliate him; and the opportunity of airing his newly-found grandeur occurred to him.  \"It was a convenience to me, certainly,\" said he, \"but I am all right now, having a salary of twelve thousand francs.\"  He thought that the artist would be dazzled, and that the mention of this sum would draw from him some exclamations of surprise and envy. Andre, however, made no reply, and Paul was obliged to wind up with the lame conclusion, \"And at my age that is not so bad.\"  \"I should call it superb. Should I be indiscreet in asking what you are doing?\"  The question was a most natural one, but Paul could not reply to it, as he was entirely ignorant as to what his employment was to be, and he felt as angry as if the painter had wantonly insulted him.  \"I work for it,\" said he, drawing himself up with such a strange expression of voice and feature that Andre could not fail to notice it.  \"I work too,\" remarked he; \"I am never idle.\"  \"But I have to work very hard,\" returned Paul, \"for I have not, like you, a friend or protector to interest himself in me.\"  Paul, who had not a particle of gratitude in his disposition, had entirely forgotten Mascarin.  The artist was much amused by this speech. \"And where do you think that a foundling, as I am, would find a protector?\"  Paul opened his eyes. \"What,\" said he, \"are you one of those?\"  \"I am; I make no secret of it, hoping that there is no occasion for me to feel shame, though there may be for grief. All my friends know this; and I am surprised that you are not aware that I am simply a foundling from the Hopital de Vendome. Up to twelve years of age I was perfectly happy, and the master praised me for the knack I had of acquiring knowledge. I used to work in the garden by day, and in the evening I wasted reams of paper; for I had made up my mind to be an artist. But nothing goes easily in this world, and one day the lady superintendent conceived the idea of apprenticing me to a tanner.\"  Paul, who had taken a seat on the divan in order to listen, here commenced making a cigarette; but Andre stopped him. \"Excuse me; but will you oblige me by not smoking?\"  Paul tossed the cigarette aside, though he was a little surprised, as the painter was an inveterate smoker. \"All right,\" said he, \"but continue your story.\"  \"I will; it is a long one. I hated the tanner's business from the very beginning. Almost the first day an awkward workman scalded me so severely that the traces still remain.\" As he spoke he rolled up his shirt sleeve, and exhibited a scar that covered nearly all one side of his arm. \"Horrified at such a commencement, I entreated the lady superintendent, a hideous old woman in spectacles, to apprentice me to some other trade, but she sternly refused. She had made up her mind that I should be a tanner.\"  \"That was very nasty of her,\" remarked Paul.  \"It was, indeed; but from that day I made up my mind, and I determined to run away as soon as I could get a little money together. I therefore stuck steadily to the business, and by the end of the year, by means of the strictest economy, I found myself master of thirty francs. This, I thought, would do, and, with a bundle containing a change of linen, I started on foot for Paris. I was only thirteen, but I had been gifted by Providence with plenty of that strong will called by many obstinacy. I had made up my mind to be a painter.\"  \"And you kept your vow?\"  \"But with the greatest difficulty. Ah! I can close my eyes and see the place where I slept that first night I came to Paris. I was so exhausted that I did not awake for twelve hours. I ordered a good breakfast; and finding funds at a very low ebb, I started in search of work.\"  Paul smiled. He, too, remembered _his_ first day in Paris. He was twenty-two years of age, and had forty francs in his pocket.  \"I wanted to make money--for I felt I needed it--to enable me to pursue my studies. A stout man was seated near me at breakfast, and to him I addressed myself.  \"'Look here,' said I, 'I am thirteen, and much stronger than I look. I can read and write. Tell me how I can earn a living.'  \"He looked steadily at me, and in a rough voice answered, 'Go to the market to-morrow morning, and try if one of the master masons, who are on the lookout for hands, will employ you.'\"  \"And you went?\"  \"I did; and was eagerly watching the head masons, when I perceived my stout friend coming toward me.  \"'I like the looks of you, my lad,' he said; 'I am an ornamental sculptor. Do you care to learn my trade?'  \"When I heard this proposal, it seemed as if Paradise was opening before me, and I agreed with enthusiasm.\"  \"And how about your painting?\"  \"That came later on. I worked hard at it in all my hours of leisure. I attended the evening schools, and worked steadily at my art and other branches of education. It was a very long time before I ventured to indulge in a glass of beer. 'No, no, Andre,' I would say to myself, 'beer costs six sous; lay the money by.' Finally, when I was earning from eighty to a hundred francs a week, I was able to give more time to the brush.\"  The recital of this life of toil and self-denial, so different from his own selfish and idle career, was inexpressibly mortifying to Paul; but he felt that he was called upon to say something.  \"When one has talents like yours,\" said he, \"success follows as a matter of course.\"  He rose to his feet, and affected to examine the sketches on the walls, though his attention was attracted to the covered picture on the easel. He remembered what the garrulous old portress had said about the veiled lady who sometimes visited the painter, and that there had been some delay in admitting him when he first knocked. Then he considered, for whom had the painter dressed himself with such care? and why had he requested him not to smoke? From all these facts Paul came to the conclusion that Andre was expecting the lady's visit, and that the veiled picture was her portrait. He therefore determined to see it; and with this end in view, he walked round the studio, admiring all the paintings on the walls, maneuvering in such a manner as to imperceptibly draw nearer to the easel.  \"And this,\" said he, suddenly extending his hand toward the cover, \"is, I presume, the gem of your studio?\"  But Andre was by no means dull, and had divined Paul's intention, and grasped the young man's outstretched hand just as it touched the curtain.  \"If I veil this picture,\" said he, \"it is because I do not wish it to be seen.\"  \"Excuse me,\" answered Paul, trying to pass over the matter as a jest, though in reality he was boiling over with rage at the manner and tone of the painter, and considered his caution utterly ridiculous.  \"At any rate,\" said he to himself, \"I will lengthen out my visit, and have a glimpse of the original instead of her picture;\" and, with this amiable resolution, he sat down by the artist's table, and commenced an apparently interminable story, resolved not to attend to any hints his friend might throw out, who was glancing at the clock with the utmost anxiety, comparing it every now and then with his watch.  As Paul talked on, he saw close to him on the table the photograph of a young lady, and, taking advantage of the artist's preoccupation, looked at it.  \"Pretty, very pretty!\" remarked he.  At these words the painter flushed crimson, and snatching away the photograph with some little degree of violence, thrust it between the leaves of a book.  Andre was so evidently in a patina, that Paul rose to his feet, and for a second or two the men looked into each other's eyes as two adversaries do when about to engage in a mortal duel. They knew but little of each other, and the same chance which had brought them together might separate them again at any moment, but each felt that the other exercised some influence over his life.  Andre was the first to recover himself.  \"You must excuse me; but I was wrong to leave so precious an article about.\"  Paul bowed with the air of a man who accepts an apology which he considers his due; and Andre went on,--  \"I very rarely receive any one except my friends; but to-day I have broken through my rule.\"  Paul interrupted him with a magniloquent wave of the hand.  \"Believe me, sir,\" said he, in a voice which he endeavoured to render cutting and sarcastic, \"had it not been for the imperative duty I before alluded to, I should not have intruded.\"  And with these words he left the room, slamming the door behind him.  \"The deuce take the impudent fool!\" muttered Andre. \"I was strongly tempted to pitch him out of the window.\"  Paul was in a furious rage for having visited the studio with the kindly desire of humiliating the painter. He could not but feel that the tables had been turned upon himself.  \"He shall not have it all his own way,\" muttered he; \"for I will see the lady,\" and not reflecting on the meanness of his conduct, he crossed the street, and took up a position from which he could obtain a good view of the house where Andre resided. It was snowing; but Paul disregarded the inclemency of the weather in his eagerness to act the spy.  He had waited for fully half an hour, when a cab drove up. Two women alighted from it. The one was eminently aristocratic in appearance, while the other looked like a respectable servant. Paul drew closer; and, in spite of a thick veil, recognized the features he had seen in the photograph.  \"Ah!\" said he, \"after all, Rose is more to my taste, and I will get back to her. We will pay up Loupins, and get out of his horrible den.\"    CHAPTER VIII.  MADEMOISELLE DE MUSSIDAN.  Paul had not been the only watcher; for at the sound of the carriage wheels the ancient portress took up her position in the doorway, with her eyes fixed on the face of the young lady. When the two women had ascended the stairs, a sudden inspiration seized her, and she went out and spoke to the cabman.  \"Nasty night,\" remarked she; \"I don't envy you in such weather as this.\"  \"You may well say that,\" replied the driver; \"my feet are like lumps of ice.\"  \"Have you come far?\"  \"Rather; I picked them up in the Champs Elysees, near the Avenue de Matignon.\"  \"That is a distance.\"  \"Yes; and only five sous for drink money. Hang your respectable women!\"  \"Oh! they are respectable, are they?\"  \"I'll answer for that. The other lot are far more open-handed. I know both of them.\"  And with these words and a knowing wink, he touched up his horse and drove away; and the portress, only half satisfied, went back to her lodge.  \"Why that is the quarter where all the swells live,\" murmured she. \"I'll tip the maid next time, and she'll let out everything.\"  After Paul's departure, Andre could not remain quiet; for it appeared to him as if each second was a century. He had thrown open the door of his studio, and ran to the head of the stairs at every sound.  At last their footsteps really sounded on the steps. The sweetest music in the world is the rustle of the beloved one's dress. Leaning over the banisters, he gazed fondly down. Soon she appeared, and in a short time had gained the open door of the studio.  \"You see, Andre,\" said she, extending her hand, \"you see that I am true to my time.\"  Pale, and trembling with emotion, Andre pressed the little hand to his lips.  \"Ah! Mademoiselle Sabine, how kind you are! Thanks, a thousand thanks.\"  Yes, it was indeed Sabine, the scion of the lordly house of Mussidan, who had come to visit the poor foundling of the Hotel de Vendome in his studio, and who thus risked all that was most precious to her in the world, her honor and her reputation. Yes, regardless of the conventionalities among which she had been reared, dared to cross that social abyss which separates the Avenue de Matignon from the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne. Cold reason finds no excuse for such a step, but the heart can easily solve this seeming riddle. Sabine and Andre had been lovers for more than two years. Their first acquaintance had commenced at the Chateau de Mussidan. At the end of the summer of 1865, Andre, whose constant application to work had told upon his health, determined to take a change, when his master, Jean Lanier, called him, and said,--  \"If you wish for a change, and at the same time to earn three or four hundred francs, now is your time. An architect has written to me, asking me for a skilled stone carver, to do some work in the country at a magnificent mansion in the midst of the most superb scenery. Would you care about undertaking this?\"  The proposal was a most acceptable one to Andre, and in a week's time he was on his way to his work with a prospect of living for a month in pure country air. Upon his arrival at the Chateau, he made a thorough examination of the work with which he had been entrusted. He saw that he could finish it with perfect ease, for it was only to restore the carved work on a balcony, which would not take more than a fortnight. He did not, however, press on the work, for the beautiful scenery enchanted him.  He made many exquisite sketches, and his health began to return to him. But there was another reason why he was in no haste to complete his task, one which he hardly ventured even to confess to himself: he had caught a glimpse of a young girl in the park of the Chateau who had caused a new feeling to spring up in his heart. It was Sabine de Mussidan. The Count, as the season came on, had gone to Germany, the Countess had flitted away to Luzon, and the daughter was sent to the dull old country mansion in charge of her old aunt. It was the old, old story; two young hearts loving with all the truth and energy of their natures. They had exchanged a few words on their first meeting, and on the next Sabine went on to the balcony and watched the rapid play of Andre's chisel with childish delight. For a long time they conversed, and Sabine was surprised at the education and refinement of the young workman. Utterly fresh, and without experience, Sabine could not understand her new sensations. Andre held, one night, a long converse with himself, and was at last obliged to confess that he loved her fondly. He ran the extent of his folly and madness, and recognized the barrier of birth and wealth that stood between them, and was overwhelmed with consternation.  The Chateau of Mussidan stands in a very lonely spot, and one of the roads leading to it passes through a dense forest, and therefore it had been arranged that Andre was to take his meals in the house. After a time Sabine began to feel that this isolation was a needless humiliation.  \"Why can't M. Andre take his meals with us?\" asked she of her aunt. \"He is certainly more gentlemanlike than many of those who visit us, and I think that his conversation would entertain you.\"  The old lady was easily persuaded to adopt this suggestion, though at first it seemed an odd kind of thing to admit a mere working man to her table; but she was so bored with the loneliness of the place that she hailed with delight anything that would break its monotony. Andre at once accepted the proposal, and the old lady would hardly believe her eyes when her guest entered the room with the dress and manners of a highbred gentleman. \"It is hardly to be believed,\" said she, as she was preparing to go to bed, \"that a mere carver of stone should be so like a gentleman. It seems to me that all distinctions of social rank have vanished. It is time for me to die, or we are rapidly approaching a state of anarchy.\"  In spite of her prejudices, however, Andre contrived to win the old lady's heart, and won a complete victory by painting her portrait in full gala costume. From that moment he was treated as one of the family, and, having no fear of a rebuff, was witty and sprightly in his manner. Once he told the old lady the true story of his life. Sabine was deeply interested, and marvelled at his energy and endurance, which had won for him a place on the ladder that leads to future eminence. She saw in him the realization of all her girlish dreams, and finally confessed to herself that she loved him. Both her father and mother had their own pleasures and pursuits, and Sabine was as much alone in the world as Andre.  The days now fled rapidly by. Buried in this secluded country house, they were as free as the breeze that played through the trees of the forest, for the old lady rarely disturbed them. After the morning meal, she would beg Andre to read the newspaper to her, and fell into a doze before he had been five minutes at the task. Then the young people would slip quietly away, as merry as truants from school. They wandered beneath the shade of the giant oaks, or climbed the rocks that stood by the river bank. Sometimes, seated in a dilapidated boat, they would drift down the stream with its flower-bedecked banks. The water was often almost covered with rushes and water lilies. Two months of enchantment thus fled past, two months of the intoxications of love, though the mention of the tender passion never rose to their lips from their hearts, where it was deeply imbedded. Andre had cast all reflections regarding the perils of the future to the winds, and only thanked heaven for the happiness that he was experiencing.  \"Am I not too happy?\" he would say to himself. \"I fear this cannot last.\" And he was right. Anxious to justify his remaining at Mussidan after his task was completed, Andre determined to add to what he had already done a masterpiece of modern art, by carving a garland of fruit and flowers over the old balcony, and every morning he rose with the sun to proceed with his task.  One morning the valet came to him, saying that the old lady was desirous of seeing him, and begged him to lose no time, as the business was urgent. A presentiment of evil came like a chilly blast upon the young man's heart. He felt that his brief dream of happiness was at an end, and he followed the valet as a criminal follows his executioner to the scaffold.  As he opened the door in which Sabine's aunt was awaiting him, the old man whispered,--  \"Have a care, sir, have a care. Madame is in a terrible state; I have not seen her like this since her husband died.\"  The old lady was in a terrible state of excitement, and in spite of rheumatic pains was walking up and down the room, gesticulating wildly, and striking her crutch-handled stick on the floor.  \"And so,\" cried she in that haughty tone adopted by women of aristocratic lineage when addressing a supposed inferior, \"you have, I hear, had the impudence to make love to my niece?\"  Andre's pale face grew crimson as he stammered out,--  \"Madame--\"  \"Gracious powers, fellow!\" cried the angry woman, \"do you dare to deny this when your very face betrays you? Do you know that you are an insolent rogue even to venture to look on Sabine de Mussidan? How dare you! Perhaps you thought that if you compromised her, we should be forced to submit to this ignoble alliance.\"  \"On my honor, madame, I assure you--\"  \"On your honor! To hear you speak, one would suppose that you were a gentleman. If my poor husband were alive, he would break every bone in your body; but I am satisfied with ordering you out of the house. Pick up your tools, and be off at once.\"  Andre stood as though petrified into stone. He took no notice of her imperious manner, but only realized the fact that he should never see Sabine again, and, turning deadly pale, staggered to a chair. The old lady was so surprised at the manner in which Andre received her communication, that for a time she too was bewildered, and could not utter a word.  \"I am unfortunately of a violent temper,\" said she, speaking in more gentle accents, \"and perhaps I have spoken too severely, for I am much to blame in this matter, as the priest of Berron said when he came to inform me of what was going on. I am so old that I forgot what happens when young people are thrown together, and I was the only one who did not know what was going on when you were affording subject of gossip for the whole countryside; my niece--\"  But here Andre started to his feet with a threatening look upon his face.  \"I could strangle them all,\" cried he.  \"That is right,\" returned the old lady, secretly pleased at his vigor and energy, \"but you cannot silence every idle tongue. Fortunately, matters have not gone too far. Go away, and forget my niece.\"  She might as well have told the young man to go away and die.  \"Madame!\" cried he in accents of despair, \"pray listen to me. I am young, and full of hope and courage.\"  The old lady was so touched by his evident sorrow, that the tears rolled down her wrinkled cheeks.  \"What is the good of saying this to me?\" asked she. \"Sabine is not my daughter. All that I can do is never to say a word to her father and mother. Great heavens, if Mussidan should ever learn what has occurred! There, do go away. You have upset me so that I do not believe I shall eat a mouthful for the next two days.\"  Andre staggered out of the room. It seemed to him as if the flooring heaved and rolled beneath his feet. He could see nothing, but he felt some one take him by the hand. It was Sabine, pallid and cold as a marble statue.  \"I have heard everything, Andre,\" murmured she.  \"Yes,\" stammered he. \"All is over, and I am dismissed.\"  \"Where are you going to?\"  \"Heaven only knows, and when once I leave this place I care not.\"  \"Do not be desperate,\" urged Sabine, laying her hand upon his arm.  His fixed glance terrified her as he muttered,--  \"I cannot help it; I am driven to despair.\"  Never had Sabine appeared so lovely; her eyes gleamed with some generous impulse, and her face glowed.  \"Suppose,\" said she, \"I could give you a ray of future hope, what would you do then?\"  \"What would I _not_ do then? All that a man could. I would fight my way through all opposition. Give me the hardest task, and I will fulfil it. If money is wanted, I will gain it; if a name, I will win it.\"  \"There is one thing that you have forgotten, and that is patience.\"  \"And that, Mademoiselle, I possess also. Do you not understand that with one word of hope from you I can live on?\"  Sabine raised her head heavenwards. \"Work!\" she exclaimed. \"Work and hope, for I swear that I will never wed other than you.\"  Here the voice of the old lady interrupted the lovers.  \"Still lingering here!\" she cried, in a voice like a trumpet call. Andre fled away with hope in his heart, and felt that he had now something to live for. No one knew exactly what happened after his departure. No doubt Sabine brought round her aunt to her way of thinking, for at her death, which happened two months afterward, she left the whole of her immense fortune directly to her niece, giving her the income while she remained single, and the capital on her marriage, whether with or without the consent of her parents. Madame de Mussidan declared that the old lady had gone crazy, but both Andre and Sabine knew what she had intended, and sincerely mourned for the excellent woman, whose last act had been to smooth away the difficulties from their path. Andre worked harder than ever, and Sabine encouraged him by fresh promises. Sabine was even more free in Paris than at Mussidan, and her attached maid, Modeste, would have committed almost any crime to promote the happiness of her beloved mistress. The lovers now corresponded regularly, and Sabine, accompanied by Modeste, frequently visited the artist's studio, and never was a saint treated with greater respect and adoration than was Sabine by Andre.    CHAPTER IX.  ROSE'S PROMOTION.  As soon as Andre had released her hand, Sabine took off her hat, and, handing it to Modeste, remarked,--  \"How am I looking to-day, Andre?\"  The young painter hastened to reassure her on this point, and she continued in joyous tones,--  \"No, I do not want compliments; I want to know if I look the right thing for sitting for my portrait.\"  Sabine was very beautiful, but hers was a different style of beauty from that of Rose, whose ripe, sensuous charms were fitted to captivate the admiration of the voluptuary, while Sabine was of the most refined and ethereal character. Rose fettered the body with earthly trammels, while Sabine drew the soul heavenward. Her beauty was not of the kind that dazzles, for the air of proud reserve which she threw over it, in some slight measure obscured its brilliancy.  She might have passed unnoticed, like the work of a great master's brush hanging neglected over the altar of a village church; but when the eye had once fathomed that hidden beauty, it never ceased to gaze on it with admiration. She had a broad forehead, covered with a wealth of chestnut hair, soft, lustrous eyes, and an exquisitely chiselled mouth.  \"Alas!\" said Andre, \"when I gaze upon you, I have to confess how impossible it is to do you justice. Before you came I had fancied that the portrait was completed, but now I see that I have only made a failure.\"  As he spoke, he drew aside the curtain, and the young girl's portrait was revealed. It was by no means a work of extraordinary merit. The artist was only twenty-four years of age, and had been compelled to interrupt his studies to toil for his daily bread, but it was full of originality and genius. Sabine gazed at it for a few moments in silence, and then murmured the words,--  \"It is lovely!\"  But Andre was too discouraged to notice her praise.  \"It is like,\" remarked he, \"but a photograph also has that merit. I have only got your features, but not your expression; it is an utter failure. Shall I try again?\"  Sabine stopped him with a gesture of denial.  \"You shall not try again,\" said she decidedly.  \"And why not?\" asked he in astonishment.  \"Because this visit will be my last, Andre.\"  \"The last?\" stammered the painter. \"In what way have I so offended you, that you should inflict so terrible a punishment on me?\"  \"I do not wish to punish you. You asked for my portrait, and I yielded to your request; but let us talk reasonably. Do you not know that I am risking my reputation by coming here day after day?\"  Andre made no reply, for this unexpected blow had almost stunned him.  \"Besides,\" continued Mademoiselle de Mussidan, \"what is to be done with the portrait? It must be hidden away, as if it were something we were ashamed of. Remember, on your success hangs our marriage.\"  \"I do not forget that.\"  \"Hasten then to gain all honor and distinction, for the world must agree with me in saying that my choice has been a wise one.\"  \"I will do so.\"  \"I fully believe you, dear Andre, and remember what I said to you a year ago. Achieve a name, then go to my father and ask for my hand. If he refuses, if my supplications do not move him, I will quit his roof forever.\"  \"You are right,\" answered Andre. \"I should indeed by a fool if I sacrificed a future happy life for a few hours of present enjoyment, and I will implicitly--\"  \"And now,\" said Sabine, \"that we have agreed on this point, let us discuss our mutual interests, of which it seems that we have been a little negligent up till now.\"  Andre at once began to tell her of all that had befallen him since they had last met, his defeats and successes.  \"I am in an awkward plight,\" said he. \"Yesterday, that well known collector, Prince Crescenzi, came to my studio. One of my pictures took his fancy, and he ordered another from me, for which he would pay six thousand francs.\"  \"That was quite a stroke of luck.\"  \"Just so, but unfortunately he wants it directly. Then Jean Lamou, who has more in his hand than he can manage, has offered me the decoration of a palatial edifice that he is building for a great speculator, M. Gandelu. I am to engage all the workmen, and shall receive some seven or eight hundred francs a month.\"  \"But how does this trouble you?\"  \"I will tell you. I have twice seen M. Gandelu, and he wants me to begin work at once; but I cannot accept both, and must choose between them.\"  Sabine reflected.  \"I should execute the Prince's commission,\" said she.  \"So should I, only----\"  The girl easily found the cause of his hesitation.  \"Will you never forget that I am wealthy?\" replied she.  \"The one would bring in the most money,\" he returned, \"and the other most credit.\"  \"Then accept the offer of M. Gandelu.\"  The old cuckoo-clock in the corner struck five.  \"Before we part, dear Andre,\" resumed she, \"I must tell you of a fresh trouble which threatens us; there is a project for marrying me to M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"  \"What, that very wealthy gentleman?\"  \"Just so.\"  \"Well, if I oppose my father's wishes, an explanation must ensue, and this just now I do not desire. I therefore intend to speak openly to M. de Breulh-Faverlay, who is an honorable, straightforward man; and when I tell him the real state of the case, he will withdraw his pretensions.\"  \"But,\" replied Andre, \"should he do so, another will come forward.\"  \"That is very possible, and in his turn the successor will be dismissed.\"  \"Ah!\" murmured the unhappy man, \"how terrible will be your life,--a scene of daily strife with your father and mother.\"  After a tender farewell, Sabine and Modeste left. Andre had wished to be permitted to go out and procure a vehicle, but this the young girl negatived, and took her leave, saying.--  \"I shall see M. de Breulh-Faverlay to-morrow.\"  For a moment after he was left alone Andre felt very sad, but a happy thought flashed across his brain.  \"Sabine,\" said he, \"went away on foot, and I may follow her without injury to her reputation.\"  In another moment he was in the street, and caught a glimpse of Sabine and her maid under a lamp at the next corner. He crossed to the other side of the way and followed them cautiously.  \"Perhaps,\" murmured he, \"the time is not far distant when I shall have the right to be with her in her walks, and feel her arm pressed against mine.\"  By this time Sabine and her companion had reached the Rue Blanche, and hailing a cab, were rapidly driven away. Andre gazed after it, and as soon as it was out of sight, decided to return to his work. As he passed a brilliantly lighted shop, a fresh young voice saluted him.  \"M. Andre, M. Andre.\"  He looked up in extreme surprise, and saw a young woman, dressed in the most extravagant style, standing by the door of a brougham, which glittered with fresh paint and varnish. In vain he tried to think who she could be, but at length his memory served him.  \"Mademoiselle Rose,\" said he, \"or I am much mistaken.\"  A shrill, squeaky voice replied, \"Madame Zora Chantemille, if you please.\"  Andre turned sharply round and found himself face to face with a young man who had completed an order he was giving to the coachman.  \"Ah, is that you?\" said he.  \"Yes, Chantemille is the name of the estate that I intend to settle on madame.\"  The painter examined the personage who had just addressed him with much curiosity. He was dressed in the height or rather the burlesque of fashion, wore an eyeglass, and an enormous locket on his chain. The face which surmounted all this grandeur was almost that of a monkey, and Toto Chupin had not exaggerated its ugliness when he likened it to that animal.  \"Pooh,\" cried Rose, \"what matters a name? All you have to do is to ask this gentleman, who is an old friend of mine, to dinner.\" And without waiting for a reply, she took Andre by the hand and led him into a brilliantly lighted hall. \"You must dine with us,\" she exclaimed; \"I will take no denial. Come, let me introduce you, M. Andre, M. Gaston de Gandelu. There, that is all settled.\"  The man bowed.  \"Andre, Andre,\" repeated Gandelu; \"why, the name is familiar to me,--and so is the face. Have I not met you at my father's house? Come in; we intend to have a jovial evening.\"  \"I really cannot,\" pleaded Andre. \"I have an engagement.\"  \"Throw it over then; we intend to keep you, now that we have got you.\"  Andre hesitated for a moment, but he felt dispirited, and that he required rousing. \"After all,\" thought he, \"why should I refuse? If this young man's friends are like himself, the evening will be an amusing one.\"  \"Come up,\" cried Rose, placing her foot upon the stairs. Andre was about to follow her, but was held back by Gandelu, whose face was radiant with delight.  \"Was there ever such a girl?\" whispered he; \"but there, don't jump at conclusions. I have only had her in hand for a short time, but I am a real dab at starting a woman grandly, and it would be hard to find my equal in Paris, you may bet.\"  \"That can be seen at a glance,\" answered Andre, concealing a smile.  \"Well, look here, I began at once. Zora is a quaint name, is it not? It was my invention. She isn't a right down swell to-day, but I have ordered six dresses for her from Van Klopen; such swell gets up! You know Van Klopen, don't you, the best man-milliner in Paris. Such taste! such ideas! you never saw the like.\"  Rose had by this time reached her drawing-room. \"Andre,\" said she, impatiently, \"are you never coming up?\"  \"Quick, quick,\" said Gandelu, \"let us go at once; if she gets into a temper she is sure to have a nervous attack, so let us hurry up.\"  Rose did all she could to dazzle Andre, and as a commencement exhibited to him her domestics, a cook and a maid; then he was shown every article of furniture, and not one was spared him. He was forced to admire the drawing-room suite covered with old gold silk, trimmed blue, and to test the thickness of the curtains. Bearing aloft a large candelabra, and covering himself with wax, Gandelu led the way, telling them the price of everything like an energetic tradesman.  \"That clock,\" said he, \"cost me a hundred louis, and dirt cheap at the price. How funny that you should have known my father! Has he not a wonderful intellect? That flower stand was three hundred francs, absolutely given away. Take care of the governor, he is as sharp as a needle. He wanted me to have a profession, but no, thank you. Yes, that occasional table was a bargain at twenty louis. Six months ago I thought that the old man would have dropped off, but now the doctors say--\" He stopped suddenly, for a loud noise was heard in the vestibule. \"Here come the fellows I invited,\" cried he, and placing the candelabra on the table, he hurried from the room.  Andre was delighted at so grand an opportunity of studying the _genus_ masher. Rose felt flattered by the admiration her fine rooms evidently caused.  \"You see,\" cried she, \"I have left Paul; he bothered me awfully, and ended by half starving me.\"  \"Why, you are joking; he came here to-day, and said he was earning twelve thousand francs a year.\"  \"Twelve thousand humbugs. A fellow that will take five hundred francs from an old scarecrow he never met before is--\"  Rose broke off abruptly, for at that moment young Gandelu brought in his friends, and introduced them; they were all of the same type as their host, and Andre was about to study them more intently, when a white-waistcoated waiter threw open the door, exclaiming pompously, \"Madame, the dinner is on the table.\"    CHAPTER X.  \"YOU ARE A THIEF.\"  When Mascarin was asked what was the best way to achieve certain results, his invariable reply was, \"Keep moving, keep moving.\" He had one great advantage over other men, he put in practice the doctrines he preached, and at seven o'clock the morning after his interview with the Count de Mussidan he was hard at work in his room. A thick fog hung over the city, even penetrating into the office, which had begun to fill with clients. This crowd had but little interest for the head of the establishment, as it consisted chiefly of waiters from small eating houses, and cooks who knew little or nothing of what was going on in the houses where they were in service. Finding this to be the case, Mascarin handed them all over to Beaumarchef, and only occasionally nodded to the serviteur of some great family, who chanced to stroll in.  He was busily engaged in arranging those pieces of cardboard which had so much puzzled Paul in his first visit, and was so much occupied with his task, that all he could do was to mutter broken exclamations: \"What a stupendous undertaking! but I have to work single-handed, and hold in my hands all these threads, which for twenty years, with the patience of a spider, I have been weaving into a web. No one, seeing me here, would believe this. People who pass me by in the street say, 'That is Mascarin, who keeps a servants' registry office;' that is the way in which they look upon me. Let them laugh if they like; they little know the mighty power I wield in secret. No one suspects me, no, not one. I may seem too sanguine, it is true,\" he continued, still glancing over his papers, \"or the net may break and some of the fishes slip out. That idiot, Mussidan, asked me if I was acquainted with the Penal code. I should think I was, for no one has studied them more deeply than I have, and there is a clause in volume 3, chapter 2, which is always before me. Penal servitude for a term of years; and if I am convicted under Article 306, then it means a life sentence.\" He shuddered, but soon a smile of triumph shone over his face as he resumed, \"Ah, but to send a man like Mascarin for change of air to Toulon, he must be caught, and that is not such an easy task. The day he scents danger he disappears, and leaves no trace behind him. I fear that I cannot look for too much from my companions, Catenac and Hortebise; I have up to now kept them back. Croisenois would never betray me, and as for Beaumarchef, La Candele, Toto Chupin, and a few other poor devils, they would be a fine haul for the police. They couldn't split, simply because they know nothing.\" Mascarin chuckled, and then adjusting his spectacles with his favorite gesture, said, \"I shall go on in the course I have commenced, straight as the flight of an arrow. I ought to make four millions through Croisenois. Paul shall marry Flavia, that is all arranged, and Flavia will make a grand duchess with her magnificent income.\"  He had by this time arranged his pasteboard squares, then he took a small notebook, alphabetically arranged, from a drawer, wrote a name or two in it, and then closing it said with a deadly smile, \"There, my friends, you are all registered, though you little suspect it. You are all rich, and think that you are free, but you are wrong, for there is one man who owns you, soul and body, and that man is Baptiste Mascarin; and at his bidding, high as you hold your heads now, you will crawl to his feet in humble abasement.\" His musings were interrupted by a knock at the door. He struck the bell on his writing table, and the last sound of it was hardly died away, when Beaumarchef stood on the threshold.  \"You desired me, sir,\" said he, with the utmost deference, \"to complete my report regarding young M. Gandelu, and it so happens that the cook whom he has taken into his service in the new establishment he has started is on our list. She has just come in to pay us eleven francs that she owed us, and is waiting outside. Is not this lucky?\"  Mascarin made a little grimace. \"You are an idiot, Beaumarchef,\" said he, \"to be pleased at so trivial a matter. I have often told you that there is no such thing as luck or chance, and that all comes to those who work methodically.\"  Beaumarchef listened to his master's wisdom in silent surprise.  \"And pray, who is this woman?\" asked Mascarin.  \"You will know her when you see her, sir. She is registered under class D, that is, for employment in rather fast establishments.\"  \"Go and fetch her,\" observed Mascarin, and as the man left the room, he muttered, \"Experience has taught me that it is madness to neglect the smallest precaution.\"  In another moment the woman appeared, and Mascarin at once addressed her with that air of friendly courtesy which made him so popular among such women. \"Well, my good girl,\" said he, \"and so you have got the sort of place you wanted, eh?\"  \"I hope so, sir, but you see I have only been with Madame Zora de Chantemille since yesterday.\"  \"Ah, Zora de Chantemille, that is a fine name, indeed.\"  \"It is only a fancy name, and she had an awful row over it with master. She wanted to be called Raphaela, but he stood out for Zora.\"  \"Zora is a very pretty name,\" observed Mascarin solemnly.  \"Yes, sir, just what the maid and I told her. She is a splendid woman, and doesn't she just squander the shiners? Thirty thousand francs have gone since yesterday.\"  \"I can hardly credit it.\"  \"Not cash, you understand, but tick. M. de Gandelu has not a sou of his own in the world, so a waiter at Potier's told me, and he knew what was what; but the governor is rolling in money. Yesterday they had a house-warming--the dinner, with wine, cost over a thousand francs.\"  Not seeing how to utilize any of this gossip, Mascarin made a gesture of dismissal, when the woman exclaimed,--  \"Stop, sir, I have something to tell you.\"  \"Well,\" said Mascarin, throwing himself back in his chair with an air of affected impatience, \"let us have it.\"  \"We had eight gents to dinner, all howling swells, but my master was the biggest masher of the lot. Madame was the only woman at table. Well, by ten o'clock, they had all had their whack of drink, and then they told the porter to keep the courtyard clear. What do you think they did then? Why, they threw plates, glasses, knives, forks, and dishes bang out of the window. That is a regular swell fashion, so the waiter at Potier's told me, and was introduced into Paris by a Russian.\"  Mascarin closed his eyes and answered languidly, \"Go on.\"  \"Well, sir, there was one gent who was a blot on the whole affair. He was tall, shabbily dressed, and with no manners at all. He seemed all the time to be sneering at the rest. But didn't Madame make up to him just. She kept heaping up his plate and filling his glass. When the others got to cards, he sat down by my mistress, and began to talk.\"  \"Could you hear what they said?\"  \"I should think so. I was in the bedroom, and they were near the door.\"  \"Dear me,\" remarked Mascarin, appearing much shocked, \"surely that was not right?\"  \"I don't care a rap whether it was right or not. I like to hear all about the people whom I engage with. They were talking about a M. Paul, who had been Madame's friend before, and whom the gentleman also knew. Madame said that this Paul was no great shakes, and that he had stolen twelve thousand francs.\"  Mascarin pricked up his ears, feeling that his patience was about to meet its reward.  \"Can you tell me the gentleman's name, to whom Madame said all this?\" asked he.  \"Not I. The others called him 'The painter.'\"  This explanation did not satisfy Mascarin.  \"Look here, my good girl,\" said he, \"try and find out the fellow's name. I think he is an artist who owes me money.\"  \"All right! Rely on me; and now I must be off, for I have breakfast to get ready, but I'll call again to-morrow;\" and with a curtsy she left the room.  Mascarin struck his hand heavily on the table.  \"Hortebise has a wonderful nose for sniffing out danger,\" said he. \"This Rose and the young fool who is ruining himself for her must both be suppressed.\"  Beaumarchef again made a motion of executing a thrust with the rapier.  \"Pooh, pooh!\" answered his master; \"don't be childish. I can do better than that. Rose calls herself nineteen, but she is more, she is of age, while Gandelu is still a minor. If old Gandelu had any pluck, he would put Article 354 in motion.\"  \"Eh, sir?\" said Beaumarchef, much mystified.  \"Look here. Before twenty-four hours have elapsed I must know everything as to the habits and disposition of Gandelu senior. I want to know on what terms he is with his son.\"  \"Good. I will set La Candele to work.\"  \"And as the young fellow will doubtless need money, contrive to let him know of our friend Verminet, the chairman of the Mutual Loan Society.\"  \"But that is M. Tantaine's business.\"  Mascarin paid no heed to this, so occupied was he by his own thoughts.  \"This young artist seems to have more brains than the rest of the set, but woe to him if he crosses my path. Go back to the outer office, Beaumarchef, I hear some clients coming in.\"  The man, however, did not obey.  \"Pardon me, sir,\" said he, \"but La Candele, who is outside, will see them. I have my report to make.\"  \"Very good. Sit down and go on.\"  Enchanted at this mark of condescension, Beaumarchef went on. \"Yesterday there was nothing of importance, but this morning Toto Chupin came.\"  \"He had not lost Caroline Schimmel, I trust?\"  \"No, sir; he had even got into conversation with her.\"  \"That is good. He is a cunning little devil; a pity that he is not a trifle more honest.\"  \"He is sure,\" continued Beaumarchef, \"that the woman drinks, for she is always talking of persons following her about who menace her, and she is so afraid of being murdered that she never ventures out alone. She lives with a respectable workingman and his wife, and pays well for her board, for she seems to have plenty of money.\"  \"That is a nuisance,\" remarked Mascarin, evidently much annoyed. \"Where does she live?\"  \"At Montmartre, beyond the Chateau Rouge.\"  \"Good. Tantaine will inquire and see if Toto has made no mistake, and does not let the woman slip through his fingers.\"  \"He won't do that, for he told me that he was on the right road to find out who she was, and where she got her money from. But I ought to warn you against the young scamp, for I have found out that he robs us and sells our goods far below their value.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I have long had my suspicions, and yesterday I wormed it all out from a disreputable looking fellow, who came here to ask for his friend Chupin.\"  Men accustomed to danger are over prompt in their decisions. \"Very well,\" returned Mascarin, \"if this is the case, Master Chupin shall have a taste of prison fare.\"  Beaumarchef withdrew, but almost immediately reappeared.  \"Sir,\" said he, \"a servant from M. de Croisenois is here with a note.\"  \"Send the man in,\" said Mascarin.  The domestic was irreproachably dressed, and looked what he was, the servant of a nobleman.  He had something the appearance of an Englishman, with a high collar, reaching almost to his ears. His face was clean shaved, and of a ruddy hue. His coat was evidently the work of a London tailor, and his appearance was as stiff as though carved out of wood. Indeed, he looked like a very perfect piece of mechanism.  \"My master,\" said he, \"desired me to give this note into your own hands.\"  Under cover of breaking the seal, Mascarin viewed this model servant attentively. He was a stranger to him, for he had never supplied Croisenois with a domestic.  \"It seems, my good fellow,\" said he, \"that your master was up earlier than usual this morning?\"  The man frowned a little at this familiar address, and then slowly replied,--  \"When I took service with the Marquis, he agreed to give me fifteen louis over my wages for the privilege of calling me 'a good fellow,' but I permit no one to do so gratis. I think that my master is still asleep,\" continued the man solemnly. \"He wrote the note on his return from the club.\"  \"Is there any reply.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Good; then wait a little.\"  And Mascarin, opening the note, read the following:  \"MY DEAR FRIEND,--  \"Baccarat has served me an ugly turn, and in addition to all my ready cash I have given an I.O.U. for three thousand francs. To save my credit I must have this by twelve to-morrow.\"  \"His credit,\" said Mascarin. \"His credit! That is a fine joke indeed.\" The servant stood up stiffly erect, as one seeming to take no notice, and the agent continued reading the letter.  \"Am I wrong in looking to you for this trifle? I do not think so. Indeed, I have an idea that you will send me a hundred and fifty louis over and above, so that I may not be left without a coin in my pocket. How goes the great affair? I await your decision on the brink of a precipice.  \"Yours devotedly,  \"HENRY DE CROISENOIS.\"   \"And so,\" growled Mascarin, \"he has flung away five thousand francs, and asks me to find it for him in my coffers. Ah, you fool, if I did not want the grand name that you have inherited from your ancestors, a name that you daily bespatter and soil, you might whistle for your five thousand francs.\"  However, as Croisenois was absolutely necessary to him, Mascarin slowly took from his safe five notes of a thousand francs each, and handed them to the man.  \"Do you want a receipt?\" asked the man.  \"No; this letter is sufficient, but wait a bit;\" and Mascarin, with an eye to the future, drew a twenty franc piece from his pocket, and placing it on the table, said in his most honeyed accents,--  \"There, my friend, is something for yourself.\"  \"No, sir,\" returned the man; \"I always ask wages enough to prevent the necessity of accepting presents.\" And with this dignified reply he bowed with the stiff air of a Quaker, and walked rigidly out of the room.  The agent was absolutely thunderstruck. In all his thirty years' experience he had never come across anything like this.  \"I can hardly believe my senses,\" muttered he; \"where on earth did the Marquis pick this fellow up? Can it be that he is sharper than I fancied?\"  Suddenly a new and terrifying idea flashed across his mind. \"Can it be,\" said he, \"that the fellow is not a real servant, after all? I have so many enemies that one day they may strive to crush me, and however skilfully I may play my cards, some one may hold a better hand.\" This idea alarmed him greatly, for he was in a position in which he had nothing to fear; for when a great work is approaching completion, the anxiety of the promoter becomes stronger and stronger. \"No, no,\" he continued; \"I am getting too full of suspicions;\" and with these words he endeavored to put aside the vague terrors which were creeping into his soul.  Suddenly Beaumarchef, evidently much excited, appeared upon the threshold.  \"What, you here again!\" cried Mascarin, angrily; \"am I to have no peace to-day?\"  \"Sir, the young man is here.\"  \"What young man? Paul Violaine?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Why, I told him not to come until twelve; something must have gone wrong.\" He broke off his speech, for at the half-open door stood Paul. He was very pale, and his eyes had the expression of some hunted creature. His attire was in disorder and betokened a night spent in aimless wanderings to and fro.  \"Ah, sir!\" said he, as he caught sight of Mascarin.  \"Leave us, Beaumarchef,\" said the latter, with an imperious wave of his hand; \"and now, my dear boy, what is it?\"  Paul sank into a chair.  \"My life is ended,\" said he; \"I am lost, dishonored for ever.\"  Mascarin put on a face of the most utter bewilderment, though he well knew the cause of Paul's utter prostration; but it was with the air of a ready sympathizer that he drew his chair nearer to that of Paul, and said,--  \"Come, tell me all about it; what can possibly have happened to affect you thus?\"  In deeply tragic tones, Paul replied,--  \"Rose has deserted me.\"  Mascarin raised his hands to heaven.  \"And is this the reason that you say you are dishonored? Do you not see that the future is full of promise?\"  \"I loved Rose,\" returned Paul, and his voice was so full of pathos that Mascarin could hardly repress a smile. \"But this is not all,\" continued the unhappy boy, making a vain effort to restrain his tears; \"I am accused of theft.\"  \"Impossible!\" exclaimed Mascarin.  \"Yes, sir; and you who know everything are the only person in the world who can save me. You were so kind to me yesterday that I ventured to come here before the time appointed, in order to entreat your help.\"  \"But what do you think I can do?\"  \"Everything, sir; but let me tell you the whole hideous complication.\"  Mascarin's face assumed an air of the deepest interest, as he answered, \"Go on.\"  \"After our interview,\" began Paul, \"I went back to the Hotel de Perou, and on the mantelpiece in my garret found this note from Rose.\"  He held it out as he spoke, but Mascarin made no effort to take it.  \"In it,\" resumed Paul, \"Rose tells me she no longer loves me, and begs me not to seek to see her again; and also that, wearied out of poverty, she has accepted the offer of unlimited supplies of money, a carriage, and diamonds.\"  \"Are you surprised at this?\" asked Mascarin, with a sneer.  \"How could I anticipate such an infidelity, when only the evening before she swore by all she held most sacred that she loved me only? Why did she lie to me? Did she write to make the blow fall heavier? When I ascended the staircase, I was picturing to myself her joy when I told her of your kind promises to me. For more than an hour I remained in my garret, overwhelmed with the terrible thought that I should never see her again.\"  Mascarin watched Paul attentively, and came to the conclusion that his words were too fine for his grief to be sincere.  \"But what about the accusation of theft?\"  \"I am coming to that,\" returned the young man. \"I then determined to obey your injunctions and leave the Hotel de Perou, with which I was more than ever disgusted. I went downstairs to settle with Madame Loupins, when ah! hideous disgrace! As I handed her the two weeks' rent, she asked me with a contemptuous sneer, where I had stolen the money from?\"  Mascarin secretly chuckled over the success of his plans thus announced by Paul.  \"What did you say?\" asked he.  \"Nothing, sir; I was too horror-stricken; the man Loupins came up, and both he and his wife scowled at me threateningly. After a short pause, they asserted that they were perfectly sure that Rose and I had robbed M. Tantaine.\"  \"But did you not deny this monstrous charge?\"  \"I was utterly bewildered, for I saw that every circumstance was against me. The evening before, Rose, in reply to Madame Loupin's importunities, had told her that she had no money, and did not know where to get any. But, as you perceive, on the very next day I appeared in a suit of new clothes, and was prepared to pay my debts, while Rose had left the house some hours before. Does not all this form a chain of strange coincidences? Rose changed the five hundred franc note that Tantaine had lent me at the shop of a grocer, named Melusin, and this suspicious fool was the first to raise a cry against us, and dared to assert that a detective had been ordered to watch us.\"  Mascarin knew all this story better than Paul, but here he interrupted his young friend.  \"I do not understand you,\" said he, \"nor whether your grief arises from indignation or remorse. Has there been a robbery?\"  \"How can I tell? I have never seen M. Tantaine from that day. There is a rumor that he has been plundered and important papers taken from him, and that he has consequently been arrested.\"  \"Why did you not explain the facts?\"  \"It would have been of no use. It would clearly prove that Tantaine was no friend of mine, not even an acquaintance, and they would have laughed me to scorn had I declared that the evening before he came into my room and made me a present of five hundred francs.\"  \"I think that I can solve the riddle,\" remarked Mascarin. \"I know the old fellow so well.\"  Paul listened with breathless eagerness.  \"Tantaine,\" resumed Mascarin, \"is the best and kindest fellow in the world, but he is not quite right in the upper story. He was a wealthy man once, but his liberality was his ruin. He is as poor as a church-mouse now, but he is as anxious as ever to be charitable. Unfortunately in the place I procured for him he had a certain amount of petty cash at his disposal, and moved to pity at the sight of your sufferings, he gave you the money that really belonged to others. Then he sent in his accounts, and the deficiency was discovered. He lost his head, and declared that he had been robbed. You lived in the next room; you were known to be in abject poverty on the one day and in ample funds on the next; hence these suspicions.\"  All was too clear to Paul, and a cold shiver ran through his frame as he saw himself arrested, tried, and condemned.  \"But,\" stammered he, \"M. Tantaine holds my note of hand, which is a proof that I acted honestly.\"  \"My poor boy, do you think that if he hoped to save himself at your expense he would produce it?\"  \"Luckily, sir, you know the real state of the case.\"  Mascarin shook is head.  \"Would my story be credited?\" asked he. \"Justice is not infallible, and I must confess that appearances are against you.\"  Paul was crushed down beneath this weight of argument. \"There is no resource for me then but death,\" murmured he, \"for I will not live a dishonored man.\"  The conduct of Paul was precisely what Mascarin had expected, and he felt that the moment had arrived to strike a final blow.  \"You must not give way to despair, my boy,\" said he.  But Paul made no reply; he had lost the power of hearing. Mascarin, however, had no time to lose, and taking him by the arm, shook him roughly. \"Rouse yourself. A man in your position must help himself, and bring forward proofs of his innocence.\"  \"There is no use in fighting,\" replied Paul. \"Have you not just shown me that it is hopeless to endeavor to prove my innocence?\"  Mascarin grew impatient at this unnecessary exhibition of cowardice, but he concealed his feelings as best he could.  \"No, no,\" answered he; \"I only wished to show you the worst side of the affair.\"  \"There is only one side.\"  \"Not so, for it is only a supposition that Tantaine had made away with money entrusted to him, and we are not certain of it. And we only surmise that he has been arrested, and thrown the blame on you. Before giving up the game, would it not be best to be satisfied on these points?\"  Paul felt a little reassured.  \"I say nothing,\" continued Mascarin, \"of the influence I exercise over Tantaine, and which may enable me to compel him to confess the truth.\"  Weak natures like Paul's are raised in a moment from the lowest depths of depression to the highest pitch of exultation, and he already considered that he was saved.  \"Shall I ever be able to prove my gratitude to you?\" said he impulsively.  Mascarin's face assumed a paternal expression.  \"Perhaps you may,\" answered he; \"and as a commencement you must entirely forget the past. Daylight dispels the hideous visions of the night. I offer you a fresh lease of life; will you become a new man?\"  Paul heaved a deep sigh. \"Rose,\" he murmured; \"I cannot forget her.\"  Mascarin frowned. \"What,\" said he, \"do you still let your thoughts dwell on that woman? There are people who cringe to the hand that strikes them, and the more they are duped and deceived, the more they love. If you are made of this kind of stuff, we shall never get on. Go and find your faithless mistress, and beg her to come back and share your poverty, and see what she will say.\"  These sarcasms roused Paul. \"I will be even with her some day,\" muttered he.  \"Forget her; that is the easiest thing for you to do.\"  Even now Paul seemed to hesitate. \"What,\" said his patron reproachfully, \"have you no pride?\"  \"I have, sir.\"  \"You have not, or you would never wish to hamper yourself with a woman like Rose. You should keep your hands free, if you want to fight your way through the battle of life.\"  \"I will follow your advice, sir,\" said Paul hurriedly.  \"Very soon you will thank Rose deeply for having left you. You will climb high, I can tell you, if you will work as I bid you.\"  \"Then,\" stammered Paul, \"this situation at twelve thousand francs a year----\"  \"There never has been such a situation.\"  A ghastly pallor overspread Paul's countenance, as he saw himself again reduced to beggary.  \"But, sir,\" he murmured, \"will you not permit me to hope--\"  \"For twelve thousand francs! Be at ease, you shall have that and much more. I am getting old. I have no ties in the world--you shall be my adopted son.\"  A cloud settled on Paul's brow, for the idea that his life was to be passed in this office was most displeasing to him. Mascarin divined his inmost thoughts with perfect ease. \"And the young fool does not know where to go for a crust of bread,\" thought he. \"Ah, if there were no Flavia, no Champdoce;\" then, speaking aloud, he resumed, \"don't fancy, my dear boy, that I wish to condemn you to the treadmill that I am compelled to pass my life in. I have other views for you, far more worthy of your merits. I have taken a great liking to you, and I will do all I can to further your ambitious views. I was thinking a great deal of you, and in my head I raised the scaffolding of your future greatness. 'He is poor,' said I, 'and at his age, and with his tastes, this is a cruel thing. Why, pray, should I not find a wife for him among those heiresses who have a million or two to give the man they marry? When I talk like this, it is because I know of an heiress, and my friend, Dr. Hortebise, shall introduce her to you. She is nearly, if not quite, as pretty as Rose, and has the advantage of her in being well-born, well-educated, and wealthy. She has influential relatives, and if her husband should happen to be a poet, or a composer, she could assist him in becoming famous.\"  A flush came over Paul's face, This seemed like the realization of some of his former dreams.  \"With regard to your birth,\" continued Mascarin, \"I have devised a wonderful plan. Before '93, you know, every bastard was treated as a gentleman, as he might have been the son of some high and mighty personage. Who can say that your father may not have been of the noblest blood of France, and that he has not lands and wealth? He may even now be looking for you, in order to acknowledge you and make you his heir. Would you like to be a duke?\"  \"Ah, sir,\" stammered the young man.  Mascarin burst into a fit of laughter. \"Up to now,\" said he, \"we are only in the region of suppositions.\"  \"Well, sir, what do you wish me to do?\" asked Paul, after a short pause.  Mascarin put on a serious face. \"I want absolute obedience from you,\" said he; \"a blind and undeviating obedience, one that makes no objections and asks no questions.\"  \"I will obey you, sir; but, oh! do not desert me.\"  Without making any reply, Mascarin rang for Beaumarchef, and as soon as the latter appeared, said, \"I am going to Van Klopen's, and shall leave you in charge here.\" Then, turning to Paul, he added, \"I always mean what I say; we will go and breakfast at a neighboring restaurant. I want to have a talk with you, and afterward--afterward, my boy, I will show you the girl I intend to be your wife. I am curious to know how you like her looks.\"    CHAPTER XI.  THE MAN-MILLINER.  Gaston de Gandelu was much surprised at finding that Andre should be ignorant of the existence of Van Klopen, the best-known man in Paris. To assure oneself of this, it was only necessary to glance at his circulars, which were ornamented with the representations of medals won at all sorts of exhibitions in different quarters of the world, together with various decorations received from foreign potentates. One had been presented to him by the Queen of Spain, while he had a diploma appointing him the supplier to the Court of the Czar. The great Van Klopen was not an Alsatian, as was generally supposed, but a stout, handsome Dutchman, who, in the year 1850, had been a tailor in his small native town, and manufactured in cloth, purchased on credit, the long waistcoats and miraculous coats worn by the wealthy citizens of Rotterdam. Van Klopen, however, was not successful in his business, and was compelled to close his shop and abscond from his creditors. He took refuge in Paris, where he seemed likely to die of hunger. One day over a magnificent establishment in the Rue de Grammont appeared a signboard with the name of Van Klopen, dressmaker, and in the thousands of handbills distributed with the utmost profusion, he called himself the \"Regenerator of Fashion.\" This was an idea that would have never originated in the brain of the phlegmatic Dutchman, and whence came the funds to carry on the business? On this point he was discreetly silent. The enterprise was at first far from a success, for during nearly a month Paris almost split its sides laughing at the absurd pretensions of the self-dubbed \"Regenerator of Fashion.\" Van Klopen bent before the storm he had aroused, and in due time his advertisements brought him two customers, who were the first to blow the trumpet of his fame. One was the Duchess de Suirmeuse, a very great lady indeed, and renowned for her eccentricities and extravagant manner, while the other was an example of another class being no less than the celebrated Jennie Fancy, who was at that time under the protection of the Count de Tremouselle; and for these two Van Klopen invented such dresses as had never been seen before. From this moment his success was certain; indeed, it was stupendous, and Paris resounded with his praises. Now he has achieved a world-wide reputation, and has nothing to fear from the attacks of his rivals. He would not execute orders for every one, saying that he must pick and choose his customers, and he did so, excising the names of such as he did not think would add to his reputation. Rank and wealth disputed the honor of being his customers. The haughtiest dames did not shrink from entrusting to him secrets of form and figure, which they even hid from their husbands. They endured without shrinking the touch of his coarse hands as he measured them. He was the rage, and his showrooms were a species of neutral ground, where women of all circles of society met and examined each other. The Duchess of --- did not shrink from being in the same room with the celebrated woman for whom the Baron de --- had blown out the few brains he possessed. Perhaps the Duchess thought that by employing the same costumier, she might also gain some of the venal beauteous attractions. Mademoiselle D---, of the Gymnase Theatre, who was well known to earn just one thousand francs per annum, took a delight in astonishing the haughty ladies of fashion by the reckless extravagance of her orders. Van Klopen, who was a born diplomatist, distributed his favors between his different customers; consequently he was termed the most charming and angelic of men. Many a time had he heard the most aristocratic lips let fall the words, \"I shall die, Van Klopen, if my dress is not ready.\" On the evenings of the most aristocratic balls a long line of carriages blocked up the road in front of his establishment, and the finest women in Paris crowded the showrooms for a word of approval from him.  He gave credit to approved customers, and also, it was whispered, lent money to them. But woe to the woman who permitted herself to be entrapped in the snare of credit that he laid for her; for the woman who owed him a bill was practically lost, never knowing to what depths she might be degraded to obtain the money to settle her account. It was not surprising that such sudden prosperity should have turned Van Klopen's head. He was stout and ruddy, impudent, vain, and cynical. His admirers said that he was witty.  It was to this man's establishment that Mascarin conducted Paul after a sumptuous breakfast at Philipe's.  It is necessary to give a slight description of Van Klopen's establishment. Carpets of the most expensive description covered the stairs to his door on the first floor, at which stood the liveried menials resplendent in gold lace and scarlet. As soon as Mascarin made his appearance, one of these gorgeous creatures hastened to him and said, \"M. Van Klopen is just now engaged with the Princess Korasoff, but as soon as he hears of your arrival he will manage to get rid of her. Will you wait for him in his private room?\"  But Mascarin answered,--  \"We are in no hurry, and may as well wait in the public room with the other customers. Are there many of them?\"  \"There are about a dozen ladies, sir.\"  \"Good; I am sure that they will amuse me.\"  And, without wasting any more words, Mascarin opened a door which led into a magnificent drawing-room, decorated in very florid style. The paper on the walls almost disappeared beneath a variety of watercolor sketches, representing ladies in every possible style of costume. Each picture had an explanatory note beneath it, such as \"Costume of Mde. de C--- for a dinner at the Russian Ambassador's,\" \"Ball costume of the Marchioness de V--- for a ball at the Hotel de Ville,\" etc.  Paul, who was a little nervous at finding himself among such splendor, hesitated in the doorway; but Mascarin seized his young friend by the arm, and, as he drew him to a settee, whispered in his ear,--  \"Keep your eyes about you; the heiress is here.\"  The ladies were at first a little surprised at this invasion of the room by the male element, but Paul's extreme beauty soon attracted their attention. The hum of conversation ceased, and Paul's embarrassment increased as he found a battery of twelve pairs of eyes directed full upon him.  Mascarin, however, was quite at his ease, and upon his entrance had made a graceful though rather old-fashioned bow to the fair inmates of the room. His coolness was partly due to the contempt he felt for the human race in general, and also to his colored glasses, which hid the expression of his countenance. When he saw that Paul still kept his eyes on the ground, he tapped him gently on the arm.  \"Is this the first time you ever saw well-dressed women? Surely you are not afraid of them. Look to the right,\" continued Mascarin, \"and you will see the heiress.\"  A young girl, not more than eighteen, was seated near one of the windows. She was not perhaps so beautiful as Mascarin had described, but her face was a very striking one nevertheless. She was slight and good-looking, with the clear complexion of a brunette. Her features were not perhaps very regular, but her glossy black hair was a beauty in itself. She had a pair of dark, melting eyes, and her wide, high forehead showed that she was gifted with great intelligence. There was an air of restrained voluptuousness about her, and she seemed the very embodiment of passion.  Paul felt insensibly attracted toward her. Their eyes met, and both started at the same moment. Paul was fascinated in an instant, and the girl's emotion was so evident that she turned aside her head to conceal it.  The babel had now commenced again, and general attention was being paid to a lady who was enthusiastically describing the last new costume which had made its appearance in the Bois de Boulogue.  \"It was simply miraculous,\" said she; \"a real triumph of Van Klopen's art. The ladies of a certain class are furious, and Henry de Croisenois tells me that Jenny Fancy absolutely shed tears of rage. Imagine three green skirts of different shades, each draped----\"  Mascarin, however, only paid attention to Paul and the young girl, and a sarcastic smile curled his lips.  \"What do you think of her?\" asked he.  \"She is adorable!\" answered Paul, enthusiastically.  \"And immensely wealthy.\"  \"I should fall at her feet if she had not a sou.\"  Mascarin gave a little cough, and adjusted his glasses.  \"Should you, my lad?\" said he to himself; \"whether your admiration is for the girl or her money, you are in my grip.\"  Then he added, aloud,--  \"Would you not like to know her name?\"  \"Tell me, I entreat you.\"  \"Flavia.\"  Paul was in the seventh heaven, and now boldly turned his eyes on the girl, forgetting that owing to the numerous mirrors, she could see his every movement.  The door was at this moment opened quietly, and Van Klopen appeared on the threshold. He was about forty-four, and too stout for his height. His red, pimply face had an expression upon it of extreme insolence, and his accent was thoroughly Dutch. He was dressed in a ruby velvet dressing-gown, with a cravat with lace ends. A huge cluster-diamond ring blazed on his coarse, red hand.  \"Who is the next one?\" asked he, rudely.  The lady who had been talking so volubly rose to her feet, but the tailor cut her short, for catching sight of Mascarin, he crossed the room, and greeted him with the utmost cordiality.  \"What!\" said he; \"is it you that I have been keeping waiting? Pray pardon me. Pray go into my private room; and this gentleman is with you? Do me the favor, sir, to come with us.\"  He was about to follow his guests, when one of the ladies started forward.  \"One word with you, sir, for goodness sake!\" cried she.  Van Klopen turned sharply upon her.  \"What is the matter?\" asked he.  \"My bill for three thousand francs falls due to-morrow.\"  \"Very likely.\"  \"But I can't meet it.\"  \"That is not my affair.\"  \"I have come to beg you will renew it for two months, or say one month, on whatever terms you like.\"  \"In two months,\" answered the man brutally, \"you will be no more able to pay than you are to-day. If you can't pay it, it will be noted.\"  \"Merciful powers! then my husband will learn all.\"  \"Just so; that will be what I want; for he will then have to pay me.\"  The wretched woman grew deadly pale.  \"My husband will pay you,\" said she; \"but I shall be lost.\"  \"That is not my lookout. I have partners whose interests I have to consult.\"  \"Do not say that, sir! He has paid my debts once, and if he should be angry and take my children from me--Dear M. Van Klopen, be merciful!\"  She wrung her hands, and the tears coursed down her cheeks; but the tailor was perfectly unmoved.  \"When a woman has a family of children, one ought to have in a needlewoman by the hour.\"  She did not desist from her efforts to soften him, and, seizing his hand, strove to carry it to her lips.  \"Ah! I shall never dare to go home,\" wailed she; \"never have the courage to tell my husband.\"  \"If you are afraid of your own husband, go to some one else's,\" said he roughly; and tearing himself from her, he followed Mascarin and Paul.  \"Did you hear that?\" asked he, as soon as he had closed the door of his room with an angry slam. \"These things occasionally occur, and are not particularly pleasant.\"  Paul looked on in disgust. If he had possessed three thousand francs, he would have given them to this unhappy woman, whose sobs he could still hear in the passage.  \"It is most painful,\" remarked he.  \"My dear sir,\" said the tailor, \"you attach too much importance to these hysterical outbursts. If you were in my place, you would soon have to put their right value on them. As I said before, I have to look after my own and my partners' interests. These dear creatures care for nothing but dress; father, husband, and children are as nothing in comparison. You cannot imagine what a woman will do in order to get a new dress, in which to outshine her rival. They only talk of their families when they are called on to pay up.\"  Paul still continued to plead for some money for the poor lady, and the discussion was getting so warm that Mascarin felt bound to interfere.  \"Perhaps,\" said he, \"you have been a little hard.\"  \"Pooh,\" returned the tailor; \"I know my customer; and to-morrow my account will be settled, and I know very well where the money will come from. Then she will give me another order, and we shall have the whole comedy over again. I know what I am about.\" And taking Mascarin into the window, he made some confidential communication, at which they both laughed heartily.  Paul, not wishing to appear to listen, examined the consulting-room, as Van Klopen termed it. He saw a great number of large scissors, yard measures, and patterns of material, and heaps of fashion plates.  By this time the two men had finished their conversation.  \"I had,\" said Mascarin, as they returned to the fireplace, \"I had meant to glance through the books; but you have so many customers waiting, that I had better defer doing so.\"  \"Is that all that hinders you?\" returned Van Klopen, carelessly. \"Wait a moment.\"  He left the room, and in another moment his voice was heard.  \"I am sorry, ladies, very sorry, on my word; but I am busy with my silk mercer. I shall not be very long.\"  \"We will wait,\" returned the ladies in chorus.  \"That is the way,\" remarked Van Klopen, as he returned to the consulting-room. \"Be civil to women, and they turn their backs on you; try and keep them off, and they run after you. If I was to put up 'no admittance' over my door, the street would be blocked up with women. Business has never been better,\" continued the tailor, producing a large ledger. \"Within the last ten days we have had in orders amounting to eighty-seven thousand francs.\"  \"Good!\" answered Mascarin; \"but let us have a look at the column headed 'Doubtful.'\"  \"Here you are,\" returned the arbiter of fashion, as he turned over the leaves. \"Mademoiselle Virginie Cluhe has ordered five theatrical costumes, two dinner, and three morning dresses.\"  \"That is a heavy order.\"  \"I wanted for that reason to consult you. She doesn't owe us much--perhaps a thousand francs or so.\"  \"That is too much, for I hear that her friend has come to grief. Do not decline the order, but avoid taking fresh ones.\"  Van Klopen made a few mysterious signs in the margin of his ledger.  \"On the 6th of this month the Countess de Mussidan gave us an order--a perfectly plain dress for her daughter. Her account is a very heavy one, and the Count has warned us that he will not pay it.\"  \"Never mind that. Go on with the order, put press for payment.\"  \"On the 7th a new customer came--Mademoiselle Flavia, the daughter of Martin Rigal, the banker.\"  When Paul heard this name, he could not repress a start, of which, however, Mascarin affected to take no notice.  \"My good friend,\" said he, turning to Van Klopen, \"I confide this young lady to you; give her your whole stock if she asks for it.\"  By the look of surprise which appeared upon the tailor's face, Paul could see that Mascarin was not prodigal of such recommendations.  \"You shall be obeyed,\" said Van Klopen, with a bow.  \"On the 8th a young gentleman of the name of Gaston de Gandelu was introduced by Lupeaux, the jeweller. His father is, I hear, very wealthy, and he will come into money on attaining his majority, which is near at hand. He brought with him a lady,\" continued the tailor, \"and said her name was Zora de Chantemille, a tremendously pretty girl.\"  \"That young man is always in my way,\" said Mascarin. \"I would give something to get him out of Paris.\"  Van Klopen reflected for a moment. \"I don't think that would be difficult,\" remarked he; \"that young fellow is capable of any act of folly for that fair girl.\"  \"I think so too.\"  \"Then the matter is easy. I will open an account with him; then, after a little, I will affect doubts as to his solvency, and ask for a bill; and we shall then place our young friend in the hands of the Mutual Loan Society, and M. Verminet will easily persuade him to write his name across the bottom of a piece of stamped paper. He will bring it to me; I will accept it, and then we shall have him hard and fast.\"  \"I should have proposed another course.\"  \"I see no other way, however,\" He suddenly stopped, for a loud noise was heard in the ante-room, and the sound of voices in loud contention.  \"I should like to know,\" said Van Klopen, rising to his feet, \"who the impudent scoundrel is, who comes here kicking up a row. I expect that it is some fool of a husband.\"  \"Go and see what it is,\" suggested Mascarin.  \"Not I! My servants are paid to spare me such annoyances.\"  Presently the noise ceased.  \"And now,\" resumed Mascarin, \"let us return to our own affairs. Under the circumstances, your proposal appears to be a good one. How about writing in another name? A little forgery would make our hands stronger.\" He rose, and taking the tailor into the window recess, again whispered to him.  During this conversation Paul's cheek had grown paler and paler, for, occupied as he was, he could not fail to comprehend something of what was going on. During the breakfast Mascarin had partially disclosed many strange secrets, and since then he had been even more enlightened. It was but too evident to him that his protector was engaged in some dark and insidious plot, and Paul felt that he was standing over a mine which might explode at any moment. He now began to fancy that there was some mysterious link between the woman Schimmel, who was so carefully watched, and the Marquis de Croisenois, so haughty, and yet on such intimate terms with the proprietor of the registry office. Then there was the Countess de Mussidan, Flavia, the rich heiress, and Gaston de Gandelu, who was to be led into a crime the result of which would be penal servitude,--all jumbled and mixed up together in one strange phantasmagoria. Was he, Paul, to be a mere tool in such hands? Toward what a precipice was he being impelled! Mascarin and Van Klopen were not friends, as he had at first supposed, but confederates in villainy. Too late did he begin to see collusion between Mascarin and Tantaine, which had resulted in his being accused of theft during his absence. But the web had been woven too securely, and should he struggle to break through it, he might find himself exposed to even more terrible dangers. He felt horrified at his position, but with this there was mingled no horror of the criminality of his associates, for the skilful hand of Mascarin had unwound and mastered all the bad materials of his nature. He was dazzled at the glorious future held out before him, and said to himself that a man like Mascarin, unfettered by law, either human or Divine, would be most likely to achieve his ends. \"I should be in no danger,\" mused he to himself, \"if I yield myself up to the impetuous stream which is already carrying me along, for Mascarin is practised swimmer enough to keep both my head and his own above water.\"  Little did Paul think that every fleeting expression in his countenance was caught up and treasured by the wily Mascarin; and it was intentionally that he had permitted Paul to listen to this compromising conversation. He had decided that very morning, that if Paul was to be a useful tool, he must be at once set face to face with the grim realities of the position.  \"Now,\" said he, \"for the really serious reason for my visit. How do we stand now with regard to the Viscountess Bois Arden?\"  Van Klopen gave his shoulders a shrug as he answered, \"She is all right. I have just sent her several most expensive costumes.\"  \"How much does she owe you?\"  \"Say twenty-five thousand francs. She has owed us more than that before.\"  \"Really?\" remarked Mascarin, \"that woman has been grossly libelled; she is vain, frivolous, and fond of admiration, but nothing more. For a whole fortnight I have been prying into her life, but I can't hit upon anything in it to give us a pull over her. The debt may help us, however. Does her husband know that she has an account with us?\"  \"Of course he does not; he is most liberal to her, and if he inquired--\"  \"Then we are all right; we will send in the bill to him.\"  \"But, my good sir,\" urged Van Klopen, \"it was only last week that she paid us a heavy sum on account.\"  \"The more reason to press her, for she must be hard up.\"  Van Klopen would have argued further, but an imperious sign from Mascarin reduced him to silence.  \"Listen to me,\" said Mascarin, \"and please do not interrupt me. Are you known to the domestics at the house of the Viscountess?\"  \"Not at all.\"  \"Well, then, at three o'clock sharp, the day after to-morrow, call on her. Her footman will say that Madame has a visitor with her.\"  \"I will say I will wait.\"  \"Not at all. You must almost force your way in, and you will find the Viscountess talking to the Marquis de Croisenois. You know him, I suppose?\"  \"By sight--nothing more.\"  \"That is sufficient. Take no notice of him; but at once present your bill, and violently insist upon immediate payment.\"  \"What can you be thinking of? She will have me kicked out of doors.\"  \"Quite likely; but you must threaten to take the bill to her husband. She will command you to leave the house, but you will sit down doggedly and declare that you will not move until you get the money.\"  \"But that is most unbusinesslike behavior.\"  \"I quite agree with you; but the Marquis de Croisenois will interfere; he will throw a pocketbook in your face, exclaiming, 'There is your money, you impudent scoundrel!'\"  \"Then I am to slink away?\"  \"Yes, but before doing so, you will give a receipt in this form--'Received from the Marquis de Croisenois, the sum of so many francs, in settlement of the account of the Viscountess Bois Arden.'\"  \"If I could only understand the game,\" muttered the puzzled Van Klopen.  \"There is no necessity for that now; only act up to your instructions.\"  \"I will obey, but remember that we shall not only lose her custom, but that of all her acquaintance.\"  Again the same angry sounds were heard in the corridor.  \"It is scandalous,\" cried a voice. \"I have been waiting an hour; my sword and armor. What, ho, lackeys; hither, I say. Van Klopen is engaged, is he? Hie to him and say I must see him at once.\"  The two accomplices exchanged looks, as though they recognized the shrill, squeaky voice.  \"That is our man,\" whispered Mascarin, as the door was violently flung open, and Gaston de Gandelu burst in. He was dressed even more extravagantly than usual, and his face was inflamed with rage.  \"Here am I,\" cried he; \"and an awful rage I am in. Why, I have been waiting twenty minutes. I don't care a curse for your rules and regulations.\"  The tailor was furious at this intrusion; but as Mascarin was present, and he felt that he must respect his orders, he by a great effort controlled himself.  \"Had I known, sir,\" said he sulkily, \"that you were here----\"  These few words mollified the gorgeous youth, who at once broke in.  \"I accept your apologies,\" cried he; \"the lackeys remove our arms, the joust is over. My horses have been standing all this time, and may have taken cold. Of course you have seen my horses. Splendid animals, are they not? Zora is in the other room. Quick, fetch her here.\"  With these words he rushed into the passage and shouted out, \"Zora, Mademoiselle de Chantemille, my dear one, come hither.\"  The renowned tailor was exquisitely uncomfortable at so terrible a scene in his establishment. He cast an appealing glance at Mascarin, but the face of the agent seemed carved in marble. As to Paul, he was quite prepared to accept this young gentleman as a perfect type of the glass of fashion and the mould of form, and could not forbear pitying him in his heart. He went across the room to Mascarin.  \"Is there no way,\" whispered he, \"of saving this poor young fellow?\"  Mascarin smiled one of those livid smiles which chilled the hearts of those who knew him thoroughly.  \"In fifteen minutes,\" said he, \"I will put the same question to you, leaving you to reply to it. Hush, this is the first real test that you have been subjected to; if you are not strong enough to go through it, then we had better say farewell. Be firm, for a thunderbolt is about to fall!\"  The manner in which these apparently trivial words were spoken startled Paul, who, by a strong effort, recovered his self-possession; but, prepared as he was, it was with the utmost difficulty that he stifled the expression of rage and surprise that rose to his lips at the sight of the woman who entered the room. The Madame de Chantemille, the Zora of the youthful Gandelu, was there, attired in what to his eyes seemed a most dazzling costume. Rose seemed a little timid as Gandelu almost dragged her into the room.  \"How silly you are!\" said he. \"What is there to be frightened at? He is only in a rage with his flunkies for having kept us waiting.\"  Zora sank negligently into an easy chair, and the gorgeously attired youth addressed the all-powerful Van Klopen.  \"Well, have you invented a costume that will be worthy of Madame's charms?\"  For a few moments Van Klopen appeared to be buried in profound meditation.  \"Ah,\" said he, raising his hand with a grandiloquent gesture, \"I have it; I can see it all in my mind's eye.\"  \"What a man!\" murmured Gaston in deep admiration.  \"Listen,\" resumed the tailor, his eye flashing with the fire of genius. \"First, a walking costume with a polonaise and a cape _a la pensionnaire_; bodice, sleeves, and underskirt of a brilliant chestnut----\"  He might have continued in this strain for a long time, and Zora would not have heard a word, for she had caught sight of Paul, and in spite of all her audacity, she nearly fainted. She was so ill at ease, that young Gandelu at last perceived it; but not knowing the effect that the appearance of Paul would necessarily cause, and being also rather dull of comprehension he could not understand the reason for it.  \"Hold hard, Van Klopen, hold hard! the joy has been too much for her, and I will lay you ten to one that she is going into hysterics.\"  Mascarin saw that Paul's temper might blaze forth at any moment, and so hastened to put an end to a scene which was as absurd as it was dangerous.  \"Well, Van Klopen, I will say farewell,\" said he. \"Good morning, madame; good morning, sir;\" and taking Paul by the arm, he led him away by a private exit which did not necessitate their passing through the great reception-room.  It was time for him to do so, and not until they were in the street did the wily Mascarin breathe freely.  \"Well, what do you say, now?\" asked he.  Paul's vanity had been so deeply wounded, and the effort that he had made to restrain himself so powerful, that he could only reply by a gasp.  \"He felt it more than I thought he would,\" said Mascarin to himself. \"The fresh air will revive him.\"  Paul's legs bent under him, and he staggered so that Mascarin led him into a little _café_ hard by, and ordered a glass of cognac, and in a short time Paul was himself once again.  \"You are better now,\" observed Mascarin; and then, believing it would be best to finish his work, he added, \"A quarter of an hour ago I promised that I would ask you to settle what our intentions were to be regarding M. de Gandelu.\"  \"That is enough,\" broke in Paul, violently.  Mascarin put on his most benevolent smile.  \"You see,\" remarked he, \"how circumstances change ideas. Now you are getting quite reasonable.\"  \"Yes, I am reasonable enough now; that is, that I mean to be wealthy. You have no need to urge me on any more. I am willing to do whatever you desire, for I will never again endure degradation like that I have gone through to-day.\"  \"You have let temper get the better of you,\" returned Mascarin, with a shrug of his shoulders.  \"My anger may pass over, but my determination will remain as strong as ever.\"  \"Do not decide without thinking the matter well over,\" answered the agent. \"To-day you are your own master; but if you give yourself up to me, you must resign your dearly loved liberty.\"  \"I am prepared for all.\"  Victory had inclined to the side of Mascarin, and he was proportionally jubilant.  \"Good,\" said he. \"Then Dr. Hortebise shall introduce you to Martin Rigal, the father of Mademoiselle Flavia, and one week after your marriage I will give you a duke's coronet to put on the panels of your carriage.\"    CHAPTER XII.  A STARTLING REVELATION.  When Sabine de Mussidan told her lover that she would appeal to the generosity of M. de Breulh-Faverlay, she had not calculated on the necessity she would have for endurance, but had rather listened to the dictates of her heart; and this fact came the more strongly before her, when in the solitude of her own chamber, she inquired of herself how she was to carry out her promise. It seemed to her very terrible to have to lay bare the secrets of her soul to any one, but the more so to M. de Breulh-Faverlay, who had asked for her hand in marriage. She uttered no word on her way home, where she arrived just in time to take her place at the dinner table, and never was a more dismal company assembled for the evening meal. Her own miseries occupied Sabine, and her father and mother were suffering from their interviews with Mascarin and Dr. Hortebise. What did the liveried servants, who waited at table with such an affectation of interest, care for the sorrows of their master or mistress? They were well lodged and well fed, and nothing save their wages did they care for. By nine o'clock Sabine was in her own room trying to grow accustomed to the thoughts of an interview with M. de Breulh-Faverlay. She hardly closed her eyes all night, and felt worn out and dispirited by musing; but she never thought of evading the promise she had made to Andre, or of putting it off for a time. She had vowed to lose no time, and her lover was eagerly awaiting a letter from her, telling him of the result. In the perplexity in which she found herself, she could not confide in either father or mother, for she felt that a cloud hung over both their lives, though she knew not what it was. When she left the convent where she had been educated, and returned home, she felt that she was in the way, and that the day of her marriage would be one of liberation to her parents from their cares and responsibilities. All this prayed terribly upon her mind, and might have driven a less pure-minded girl to desperate measures. It seemed to her that it would be less painful to fly from her father's house than to have this interview with M. de Breulh-Faverlay. Luckily for her, frail as she looked, she possessed an indomitable will, and this carried her through most of her difficulties.  For Andre's sake, as well as her own, she did not wish to violate any of the unwritten canons of society, but she longed for the hour to come when she could acknowledge her love openly to the world. At one moment she thought of writing a letter, but dismissed the thought as the height of folly. As the time passed Sabine began to reproach herself for her cowardice. All at once she heard the clang of the opening of the main gates. Peeping from her window, she saw a carriage drive up, and, to her inexpressible delight, M. de Breulh-Faverlay alighted from it.  \"Heaven has heard my prayer, and sent him to me,\" murmured she.  \"What do you intend to do, Mademoiselle?\" asked the devoted Modeste; \"will you speak to him now?\"  \"Yes, I will. My mother is still in her dressing-room, and no one will venture to disturb my father in the library. If I meet M. de Breulh-Faverlay in the hall and take him into the drawing-room, I shall have time for a quarter of an hour's talk, and that will be sufficient.\"  Calling up all her courage, she left her room on her errand. Had Andre seen the man selected by the Count de Mussidan for his daughter's husband, he might well have been proud of her preference for him. M. de Breulh-Faverlay was one of the best known men in Paris, and fortune had showered all her blessings on his head. He was not forty, of an extremely aristocratic appearance, highly educated, and witty; and, in addition, one of the largest landholders in the country. He had always refused to enter public life. \"For,\" he would say to those who spoke to him on the matter, \"I have enough to spend my money on without making myself ridiculous.\" He was a perfect type of what a French gentleman should be--courteous, of unblemished reputation, and full of chivalrous devotion and generosity. He was, it is said, a great favorite with the fair sex; but, if report spoke truly, his discretion was as great as his success. He had not always been wealthy, and there was a mysterious romance in his life. When he was only twenty, he had sailed for South America, where he remained twelve years, and returned no richer than he was before; but shortly afterward his aged uncle, the Marquis de Faverlay, died bequeathing his immense fortune to his nephew on the condition that he should add the name of Faverlay to that of De Breulh. De Breulh was passionately fond of horses; but he was really a lover of them, and not a mere turfite, and this was all that the world knew of the man who held in his hands the fates of Sabine de Mussidan and Andre. As soon as he caught sight of Sabine he made a profound inclination.  The girl came straight up to him.  \"Sir,\" said she, in a voice broken by conflicting emotions, \"may I request the pleasure of a short private conversation with you?\"  \"Mademoiselle,\" answered De Breulh, concealing his surprise beneath another bow, \"I am at your disposal.\"  One of the footmen, at a word from Sabine, threw open the door of the drawing-room in which the Countess had thrown down her arms in her duel with Dr. Hortebise. Sabine did not ask her visitor to be seated, but leaning her elbow on the marble mantel-piece, she said, after a silence equally trying to both,--  \"This strange conduct on my part, sir, will show you, more than any explanation, my sincerity, and the perfect confidence with which you have inspired me.\"  She paused, but De Breulh made no reply, for he was perfectly mystified.  \"You are,\" she continued, \"my parents' intimate friend, and must have seen the discomforts of our domestic hearth, and that though both my father and mother are living, I am as desolate as the veriest orphan.\"  Fearing that M. de Breulh might not understand her reason for speaking thus, she threw a shade of haughtiness into her manner as she resumed,--  \"My reason, sir, for seeing you to-day is to ask,--nay, to entreat you, to release me from my engagement to you, and to take the whole responsibility of the rupture on yourself.\"  Man of the world as he was, M. de Breulh could not conceal his surprise, in which a certain amount of wounded self-love was mingled.  \"Mademoiselle!\" commenced he--  Sabine interrupted him.  \"I am asking a great favor, and your granting it will spare me many hours of grief and sadness, and,\" she added, as a faint smile flickered across her pallid features, \"I am aware that I am asking but a trifling sacrifice on your part. You know scarcely anything of me, and therefore you can only feel indifference toward me.\"  \"You are mistaken,\" replied the young man gravely; \"and you do not judge me rightly. I am not a mere boy, and always consider a step before I take it; and if I asked for your hand, it was because I had learned to appreciate the greatness both of your heart and intellect; and I believe that if you would condescend to accept me, we could be very happy together.\"  The girl seemed about to speak, but De Breulh continued,--  \"It seems, however, that I have in some way displeased you,--I do not know how; but, believe me, it will be a source of sorrow to me for the rest of my life.\"  De Breulh's sincerity was so evident, that Mademoiselle de Mussidan was deeply affected.  \"You have not displeased me in any way,\" answered she softly, \"and are far too good for me. To have become your wife would have made me a proud and happy woman.\"  Here she stopped, almost choked by her tears, but M. de Breulh wished to fathom this mystery.  \"Why then this resolve?\" asked he.  \"Because,\" replied Sabine faintly, as she hid her face,--\"because I have given all my love to another.\"  The young man uttered an exclamation so full of angry surprise, that Sabine turned upon him at once.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered she, \"to another; one utterly unknown to my parents, yet one who is inexpressibly dear to me. This ought not to irritate you, for I gave him my love long before I met you. Besides, you have every advantage over him. He is at the foot, while you are at the summit, of the social ladder. You are of aristocratic lineage,--he is one of the people. You have a noble name,--he does not even know his own. Your wealth is enormous,--while he works hard for his daily bread. He has all the fire of genius, but the cruel cares of life drag and fetter him to the earth. He carries on a workman's trade to supply funds to study his beloved art.\"  Incautiously, Sabine had chosen the very means to wound this noble gentleman most cruelly, for her whole beauty blazed out as, inflamed by her passion, she spoke so eloquently of Andre and drew such a parallel between the two young men.  \"Now, sir,\" said she, \"do you comprehend me? I know the terrible social abyss which divides me from the man I love, and the future may hold in store some terrible punishment for my fidelity to him, but no one shall ever hear a word of complaint from my lips, for----\" she hesitated, and then uttered these simple words--\"for I love him.\"  M. de Breulh listened with an outwardly impassible face, but the venomed tooth of jealousy was gnawing at his heart. He had not told Sabine the entire truth, for he had studied her for a long time, and his love had grown firm and strong. Without an unkind thought the girl had shattered the edifice which he had built up with such care and pain. He would have given his name, rank, and title to have been in this unknown lover's place, who, though he worked for his bread, and had no grand ancestral name, was yet so fondly loved. Many a man in his position would have shrugged his shoulders and coldly sneered at the words, \"I love him,\" but he did not, for his nature was sufficiently noble to sympathize with hers. He admired her courage and frankness, which disdaining all subterfuges, went straight and unhesitatingly to the point she desired to reach. She might be imprudent and reckless, but in his eyes these seemed hardly to be faults, for it is seldom that convent-bred young ladies err in this way.  \"But this man,\" said he, after a long pause,--\"how do you manage ever to see him?  \"I meet him out walking,\" replied she, \"and I sometimes go to his studio.\"  \"To his studio?\"  \"Yes, I have sat to him several times for my portrait; but I have never done anything that I need blush to own. You know all now, sir,\" continued Sabine; \"and it has been very hard for a young girl like me to say all this to you. It is a thing that ought to be confided to my mother.\"  Only those who have heard a woman that they are ardently attached to say, \"I do not love you,\" can picture M. de Breulh's frame of mind. Had any one else than Sabine made this communication he would not have withdrawn, but would have contested the prize with his more fortunate rival. But now that Mademoiselle de Mussidan had, as it were, thrown herself upon his mercy, he could not bring himself to take advantage of her confidence.  \"It shall be as you desire,\" said he, with a faint tinge of bitterness in his tone. \"To-night I will write to your father, and withdraw my demand for your hand. It is the first time that I have ever gone back from my word; and I am sure that your father will be highly indignant.\"  Sabine's strength and firmness had now entirely deserted her. \"From the depth of my soul, sir,\" said she, \"I thank you; for by this act of generosity I shall avoid a contest that I dreaded.\"  \"Unfortunately,\" broke in De Breulh, \"you do not see how useless to you will be the sacrifice that you exact from me. Listen! you have not appeared much in society; and when you did, it was in the character of my betrothed; as soon as I withdraw hosts of aspirants for your hand will spring up.\"  Sabine heaved a deep sigh, for Andre had foreseen the same result.  \"Then,\" continued De Breulh, \"your situation will become even a more trying one; for if your noble qualities are not enough to excite admiration in the bosoms of the other sex, your immense wealth will arouse the cupidity of the fortune-hunters.\"  When De Breulh referred to fortune-hunters, was this a side blow at Andre? With this thought rushing through her brain, she gazed upon him eagerly, but read no meaning in his eyes.  \"Yes,\" answered she dreamily, \"it is true that I am very wealthy.\"  \"And what will be your reply to the next suitor, and to the one after that?\" asked De Breulh.  \"I know not; but I shall find some loophole of escape when the time comes; for if I act in obedience to the dictates of my heart and conscience, I cannot do wrong, for Heaven will come to my aid.\"  The phrase sounded like a dismissal; but De Breulh, man of the world as he was, did not accept it.  \"May I permit myself to offer you a word of advice?\"  \"Do so, sir.\"  \"Very well, then; why not permit matters to remain as they now are? So long as our rupture is not public property, so long will you be left in peace. It would be the simplest thing in the world to postpone all decisive steps for a twelvemonth, and I would withdraw as soon as you notified me that it was time.\"  Sabine put every confidence in this proposal, believing that everything was in good faith. \"But,\" said she, \"such a subterfuge would be unworthy of us all.\"  M. de Breulh did not urge this point; a feeling of deep sympathy had succeeded to his wounded pride; and, with all the chivalrous instinct of his race, he determined to do his best to assist these lovers.  \"Might I be permitted,\" asked he, \"now that you have placed so much confidence in me, to make the acquaintance of the man whom you have honored with your love?\"  Sabine colored deeply. \"I have no reason to conceal anything from you: his name is Andre, he is a painter, and lives in the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne.\"  De Breulh made a mental note of the name, and continued,--  \"Do not think that I ask this question from mere idle curiosity; my only desire is to aid you. I should be glad to be a something in your life. I have influential friends and connections----\"  Sabine was deeply wounded. Did this man propose patronizing Andre, and thus place his position and wealth in contrast with that of the obscure painter? In his eagerness de Breulh had made a false move.  \"I thank you,\" answered she coldly; \"but Andre is very proud, and any offer of assistance would wound him deeply. Forgive my scruples, which are perhaps exaggerated and absurd. All he has of his own are his self-respect and his natural pride.\"  As she spoke, Sabine rang the bell, to show her visitor that the conversation was at an end.  \"Have you informed my mother of M. de Breulh-Faverlay's arrival?\" asked she, as the footman appeared at the door.  \"I have not, mademoiselle; for both the Count and Countess gave the strictest order that they were not to be disturbed on any pretext whatsoever.\"  \"Why did you not tell me that before?\" demanded M. de Breulh; and, without waiting for any explanation, he bowed gravely to Sabine, and quitted the room, after apologizing for his involuntary intrusion, and by his manner permitted all the domestics to see that he was much put out.  \"Ah!\" sighed Sabine, \"that man is worthy of some good and true woman's affection.\"  As she was about to leave the room, she heard some one insisting upon seeing the Count de Mussidan. Not being desirous of meeting strangers, she remained where she was. The servant persisted in saying that his master could receive no one.  \"What do I care for your orders?\" cried the visitor; \"your master would never refuse to see his friend the Baron de Clinchain;\" and, thrusting the lackey on one side, he entered the drawing-room; and his agitation was so great that he hardly noticed the presence of the young girl.  M. de Clinchain was a thoroughly commonplace looking personage in face, figure, and dress, neither tall nor short, handsome nor ill-looking. The only noticeable point in his attire was that he wore a coral hand on his watch chain; for the Baron was a firm believer in the evil eye. When a young man, he was most methodical in his habits; and, as he grew older, this became an absolute mania with him. When he was twenty, he recorded in his diary the pulsations of his heart, and at forty he added remarks regarding his digestion and general health.  \"What a fearful blow!\" murmured he; \"and to fall at such a moment when I had indulged in a more hearty dinner than usual. I shall feel it for the next six months, even if it does not kill me outright.\"  Just then M. de Mussidan entered the room, and the excited man ran up to him, exclaiming,--  \"For Heaven's sake, Octave, save us both, by cancelling your daughter's engagement with M. de--\"  The Count laid his hand upon his friend's lips.  \"Are you mad?\" said he; \"my daughter is here.\"  In obedience to a warning gesture, Sabine left the room; but she had heard enough to fill her heart with agitation and terror. What engagement was to be cancelled, and how could such a rupture affect her father or his friend? That there was some mystery, was proved by the question with which the Count had prevented his friend from saying any more. She was sure that it was the name of M. de Breulh-Faverlay with which the Baron was about to close his sentence, and felt that the destiny of her life was to be decided in the conversation about to take place between her father and his visitor. It was deep anxiety that she felt, not mere curiosity; and while these thoughts passed through her brain, she remembered that she could hear all from the card-room, the doorway of which was only separated from the drawing-room by a curtain. With a soft, gliding step she gained her hiding-place and listened intently. The Baron was still pouring out his lamentations.  \"What a fearful day this has been!\" groaned the unhappy man. \"I ate much too heavy a breakfast, I have been terribly excited, and came here a great deal too fast. A fit of passion caused by a servant's insolence, joy at seeing you, then a sudden interruption to what I was going to say, are a great deal more than sufficient to cause a serious illness at my age.\"  But the Count, who was usually most considerate of his friend's foibles, was not in a humor to listen to him.  \"Come, let us talk sense,\" said he sharply; \"tell me what has occurred.\"  \"Occurred!\" groaned De Clinchain; \"oh, nothing, except that the whole truth is known regarding what took place in the little wood so many years back. I had an anonymous letter this morning, threatening me with all sorts of terrible consequences if I do not hinder you from marrying your daughter to De Breulh. The rogues say that they can prove everything.\"  \"Have you the letter with you?\"  De Clinchain drew the missive from his pocket. It was to the full as threatening as he had said; but M. de Mussidan knew all its contents beforehand.  \"Have you examined your diary, and are the three leaves really missing?\"  \"They are.\"  \"How were they stolen? Are you sure of your servants?\"  \"Certainly; my valet has been sixteen years in my service. You know Lorin? The volumes of my diary are always locked up in the escritoire, the key of which never leaves me. And none of the other servants ever enter my room.\"  \"Some one must have done so, however.\"  Clinchain struck his forehead, as though an idea had suddenly flashed across his brain.  \"I can partly guess,\" said he. \"Some time ago Lorin went for a holiday, and got drunk with some fellows he picked up in the train. Drink brought on fighting, and he was so knocked about that he was laid up for some weeks. He had a severe knife wound in the shoulder and was much bruised.\"  \"Who took his place?\"  \"A young fellow that my groom got at a servants' registry office.\"  M. de Mussidan felt that he was on the right track, for he remembered that the man who had called on him had had the audacity to leave a card, on which was marked:  \"B. MASCARIN,  \"Servants' Registry Office, \"Rue Montorgueil.\"  \"Do you know where this place is?\" asked he.  \"Certainly; in the Rue du Dauphin nearly opposite to my house.\"  The Count swore a deep oath. \"The rogues are very wily; but, my dear fellow if you are ready, we will defy the storm together.\"  De Clinchain felt a cold tremor pass through his whole frame at this proposal.  \"Not I,\" said he; \"do not try and persuade me. If you have come to this decision, let me know at once, and I will go home and finish it all with a pistol bullet.\"  He was just the sort of nervous, timorous man to do exactly as he said, and would sooner have killed himself than endure all kinds of annoyance, which might impair his digestion.  \"Very well,\" answered his friend, with sullen resignation, \"then I will give in.\"  De Clinchain heaved a deep sigh of relief, for he, not knowing what had passed before, had expected to have had a much more difficult task in persuading his friend.  \"You are acting like a reasonable man for once in your life,\" said he.  \"You think so, because I give ear to your timorous advice. A thousand curses on that idiotic habit of yours of putting on paper not only your own secrets, but those of others.\"  But at this remark Clinchain mounted his hobby.  \"Do not talk like that,\" said he. \"Had you not committed the act, it would not have appeared in my diary.\"  Chilled to the very bone, and quivering like an aspen leaf, Sabine had listened to every word. The reality was even more dreadful than she had dreamed of. There was a hidden sorrow, a crime in her father's past life.  Again the Count spoke. \"There is no use in recrimination. We cannot wipe out the past, and must, therefore, submit. I promise you, on my honor, that this day I will write to De Breulh, and tell him this marriage must be given up.\"  These words threw the balm of peace and safety into De Clinchain's soul, but the excess of joy was too much for him, and murmuring, \"Too much breakfast, and the shock of too violent an emotion,\" he sank back, fainting, on a couch.  The Count de Mussidan was terrified, he pulled the bell furiously, and the domestics rushed in, followed by the Countess. Restoratives were applied, and in ten minutes the Baron opened one eye, and raised himself on his elbow.  \"I am better now,\" said he, with a faint smile. \"It is weakness and dizziness. I know what I ought to take--two spoonfuls of _eau des carmes_ in a glass of sugar and water, with perfect repose of both mind and body. Fortunately, my carriage is here. Pray, be prudent, Mussidan.\" And, leaning upon the arm of one of the lackeys, he staggered feebly out, leaving the Count and Countess alone, and Sabine still listening from her post of espial in the card-room.    CHAPTER XIII.  HUSBAND AND WIFE.  Ever since Mascarin's visit, the Count de Mussidan had been in a deplorable state of mind. Forgetting the injury to his foot, he passed the night pacing up and down the library, cudgelling his brains for some means of breaking the meshes of the net in which he was entangled. He knew the necessity for immediate action, for he felt sure that this demand would only be the forerunner of numerous others of a similar character. He thought over and dismissed many schemes. Sometimes he had almost decided to go to the police authorities and make a clean breast; then the idea of placing the affair in the hands of a private detective occurred to him; but the more he deliberated, the more he realized the strength of the cord that bound him, and the scandal which exposure would cause. This long course of thought had in some measure softened the bitterness of his wrath, and he was able to receive his old friend M. de Clinchain with some degree of calmness. He was not at all surprised at the receipt of the anonymous letter,--indeed, he had expected that a blow would be struck in that direction. Still immersed in thought, M. de Mussidan hardly took heed of his wife's presence, and he still paced the room, uttering a string of broken phrases. This excited the attention of the Countess, for her own threatened position caused her to be on the alert.  \"What is annoying you, Octave?\" asked she. \"Surely, not M. de Clinchain's attack of indigestion?\"  For many years the Count had been accustomed to that taunting and sarcastic voice, but this feeble joke at such a moment was more than he could endure.  \"Don't address me in that manner,\" said he angrily.  \"What is the matter--are you not well?\"  \"Madame!\"  \"Will you have the kindness to tell me what has taken place?\"  The color suffused the Count's face, and his rage burst forth the more furiously from his having had to suppress it so long; and coming to a halt before the chair in which the Countess was lounging, his eyes blazing with hate and anger, he exclaimed,--  \"All I wish to tell you is, that De Breulh-Faverlay shall not marry our daughter.\"  Madame de Mussidan was secretly delighted at this reply, for it showed her that half the task required of her by Dr. Hortebise had been accomplished without her interference; but in order to act cautiously, she began at once to object, for a woman's way is always at first to oppose what she most desires.  \"You are laughing at me, Count!\" said she. \"Where can we hope to find so good a match again?\"  \"You need not be afraid,\" returned the Count, with a sneer; \"you shall have another son-in-law.\"  These words sent a pang through the heart of the Countess. Was it an allusion to the past? or had the phrase dropped from her husband's lips accidentally? or had he any suspicion of the influence that had been brought to bear upon her? She, however, had plenty of courage, and would rather meet misfortune face to face than await its coming in dread.  \"Of what other son-in-law are you speaking?\" asked she negligently. \"Has any other suitor presented himself? May I ask his name? Do you intend to settle my child's future without consulting me?\"  \"I do, madame.\"  A contemptuous smile crossed the face of the Countess, which goaded the Count to fury.  \"Am I not the master here?\" exclaimed he in accents of intense rage. \"Am I not driven to the exercise of my power by the menaces of a pack of villains who have wormed out the hidden secrets which have overshadowed my life from my youth upward? They can, if they desire, drag my name through the mire of infamy.\"  Madame de Mussidan bounded to her feet, asking herself whether her husband's intellect had not given way.  \"You commit a crime!\" gasped she.  \"I, madame, I myself! Does that surprise you? Have you never had any suspicion? Perhaps you have not forgotten a fatal accident which took place out shooting, and darkened the earlier years of our married life? Well, the thing was not an accident, but a deliberate murder committed by me. Yes, I murdered him, and this fact is known, and can be proved.\"  The Countess grew deadly pale, and extended her hand, as though to guard herself from some coming danger.  \"You are horrified, are you?\" continued the Count, with a sneer. \"Perhaps I inspire you with horror; but do not fear; the blood is no longer on my hands, but it is here, and is choking me.\" And as he spoke he pressed his fingers upon his heart. \"For twenty-three years I have endured this hideous recollection and even now when I wake in the night I am bathed in cold sweat, for I fancy I can hear the last gasps of the unhappy man.\"  \"This is horrible, too horrible!\" murmured Madame de Mussidan faintly.  \"Ah, but you do not know why I killed him,--it was because the dead man had dared to tell me that the wife I adored with all the passion of my soul was unfaithful to me.\"  Words of eager denial rose to the lips of the Countess; but her husband went on coldly, \"And it was all true, for I heard all later on.  \"Poor Montlouis! _he_ was really loved. There was a little shop-girl, who toiled hard for daily bread, but she was a thousand times more honorable than the haughty woman of noble race that I had just married.\"  \"Have mercy, Octave.\"  \"Yes, and she fell a victim to her love for Montlouis. Had he lived, he would have made her his wife. After his death, she could no longer conceal her fault. In small towns the people are without mercy; and when she left the hospital with her baby at her breast, the women pelted her with mud. But for me,\" continued the Count, \"she would have died of hunger. Poor girl! I did not allow her much, but with it she managed to give her son a decent education. He has now grown up, and whatever happens, his future is safe.\"  Had M. de Mussidan and his wife been less deeply engaged in this hideous recital, they would have heard the stifled sobs that came from the adjoining room.  The Count felt a certain kind of savage pleasure in venting the rage, that had for years been suppressed, upon the shrinking woman before him. \"Would it not be a cruel injustice, madame, to draw a comparison between you and this unhappy girl? Have you always been deaf to the whisperings of conscience? and have you never thought of the future punishment which most certainly awaits you? for you have failed in the duties of daughter, wife, and mother.\"  Generally the Countess cared little for her husband's reproaches, well deserved as they might be, but to-day she quailed before him.  \"With your entrance into my life,\" continued the Count, \"came shame and misfortune. When people saw you so gay and careless under the oak-trees of your ancestral home, who could have suspected that your heart contained a dark secret? When my only wish was to win you for my wife, how did I know that you were weaving a hideous conspiracy against me? Even when so young, you were a monster of dissimulation and hypocrisy. Guilt never overshadowed your brow, nor did falsehood dim the frankness of your eyes. On the day of our marriage I mentally reproached myself for any unworthiness. Wretched fool that I was, I was happy beyond all power of expression, when you, madame, completed the measure of your guilt by adding infidelity to it.\"  \"It is false,\" murmured the Countess. \"You have been deceived.\"  M. de Mussidan laughed a grim and terrible laugh.  \"Not so,\" answered he; \"I have every proof. This seems strange to you, does it? You have always looked upon me as one of those foolish husbands that may be duped without suspicion on their parts. You thought that you had placed a veil over my eyes, but I could see through it when you little suspected that I could do so. Why did I not tell you this before? Because I had not ceased to love you, and this fatal love was stronger than all honor, pride, and even self-respect.\" He poured out this tirade with inconceivable rapidity, and the Countess listened to it in awe-struck silence. \"I kept silence,\" continued the Count, \"because I knew that on the day I uttered the truth you would be entirely lost to me. I might have killed you; I had every right to do so, but I could not live apart from you. You will never know how near the shadow of death has been to you. When I have kissed you, I have fancied that your lips were soiled with the kisses of others, and I could hardly keep my hands from clutching your ivory neck until life was extinct, and failed utterly to decide whether I loved you or hated you the most.\"  \"Have mercy, Octave! have mercy!\" pleaded the unhappy woman.  \"You are surprised, I can see,\" answered he, with a dark smile; \"yet I could give you further food for wonder if I pleased, but I have said enough now.\"  A tremor passed over the frame of the Countess. Was her husband acquainted with the existence of the letters? All hinged upon this. He could not have read them, or he would have spoken in very different terms, had he known the mystery contained in them.  \"Let me speak,\" began she.  \"Not a word,\" replied her husband.  \"On my honor--\"  \"All is ended; but I must not forget to tell you of one of my youthful follies. You may laugh at it, but that signifies nothing. I actually believed that I could gain your affection. I said to myself that one day you would be moved by my deep passion for you. I was a fool. As if love or affection could ever penetrate the icy barriers that guarded your heart.\"  \"You have no pity,\" wailed she.  He gazed upon her with eyes in which the pent-up anger of twenty years blazed and consumed slowly. \"And you, what are you? I drained to the bottom the poisoned cup held out to a deceived husband by an unfaithful wife. Each day widened the breach between us, until at last we sank into this miserable existence which is wearing out my life. I kept no watch on you; I was not made for a jailer. What I wanted was your soul and heart. To imprison the body was easy, but your soul would still have been free to wander in imagination to the meeting-place where your lover expected you. I know not how I had the courage to remain by your side. It was not to save an honor that had already gone, but merely to keep up appearances; for as long as we were nominally together the tongue of scandal was forced to remain silent.\"  Again the unhappy woman attempted to protest her innocence, and again the Count paid no heed to her. \"I wished too,\" resumed he, \"to save some portion of our property, for your insatiable extravagance swallowed up all like a bottomless abyss. At last your trades-people, believing me to be ruined, refused you credit, and this saved me. I had my daughter to think of, and have gathered together a rich dowry for her, and yet----\" he hesitated, and ceased speaking for a moment.  \"And yet,\" repeated Madame de Mussidan.  \"I have never kissed her,\" he burst forth with a fresh and terrible explosion of wrath, \"without feeling a hideous doubt as to whether she was really my child.\"  This was more than the Countess could endure.  \"Enough,\" she cried, \"enough! I have been guilty, Octave; but not so guilty as you imagine.\"  \"Why do you venture to defend yourself?\"  \"Because it is my duty to guard Sabine.\"  \"You should have thought of this earlier,\" answered the Count with a sneer. \"You should have moulded her mind--have taught her what was noble and good, and have perused the unsullied pages of the book of her young heart.\"  In the deepest agitation the Countess answered,--  \"Ah, Octave, why did you not speak of this sooner, if you knew all; but I will now tell you everything.\"  By an inconceivable error of judgment the Count corrected her speech. \"Spare us both,\" said he. \"If I have broken through the silence that I have maintained for many a year, it is because I knew that no word you could utter would touch my heart.\"  Feeling that all hope had fled, Madame de Mussidan fell backward upon the couch, while Sabine, unable to listen to any more terrible revelations, had crept into her own chamber. The Count was about to leave the drawing-room, when a servant entered, bearing a letter on a silver salver. De Mussidan tore it open; it was from M. de Breulh-Faverlay, asking to be released from his engagement to Sabine de Mussidan. This last stroke was almost too much for the Count's nerves, for in this act he saw the hand of the man who had come to him with such deadly threats, and terror filled his soul as he thought of the far-stretching arm of him whose bondslave he found himself to be; but before he could collect his thoughts, his daughter's maid went into the room crying with all her might, \"Help, help; my poor mistress is dying!\"    CHAPTER XIV.  FATHER AND DAUGHTER.  Van Klopen, the man-milliner, knew Paris and its people thoroughly like all tradesmen who are in the habit of giving large credit. He knew all about the business of his customers, and never forgot an item of information when he received one. Thus, when Mascarin spoke to him about the father of the lovely Flavia, whose charms had set the susceptible heart of Paul Violaine in a blaze, the arbiter of fashion had replied,--  \"Martin Rigal; yes, I know him; he is a banker.\" And a banker, indeed, Martin Rigal was, dwelling in a magnificent house in the Rue Montmartre. The bank was on the ground floor, while his private rooms were in the story above. Though he did not do business in a very large way, yet he was a most respectable man, and his connection was chiefly with the smaller trades-people, who seem to live a strange kind of hand-to-mouth existence, and who might be happy were it not for the constant reappearance of that grim phantom--bills to be met. Nearly all these persons were in the banker's hands entirely. Martin Rigal used his power despotically and permitted no arguments, and speedily quelled rebellion on the part of any new customer who ventured to object to his arbitrary rules. In the morning the banker was never to be seen, being engaged in his private office, and not a clerk would venture to knock at his door. Even had one done so, no reply would have been returned; for the experiment had been tried, and it was believed that nothing short of an alarm of fire would have brought him out.  The banker was a big man, quite bald, his face was clean shaved, and his little gray eyes twinkled incessantly. His manner was charmingly courteous, and he said the most cruel things in the most honied accents, and invariably escorted to the door the man whom he would sell up the next day. In his dress he affected a fashionable style, much used by the modern school of Shylocks. When not in business, he was a pleasant, and, as some say, a witty companion. He was not looked on as an ascetic, and did not despise those little pleasures which enable us to sustain life's tortuous journey. He liked a good dinner, and had always a smile ready for a young and attractive face. He was a widower, and all his love was concentrated on his daughter. He did not keep a very extravagant establishment, but the report in the neighborhood was that Mademoiselle Flavia, the daughter of the eminent banker, would one day come into millions. The banker always did his business on foot, for the sake of his health, as he said; but Flavia had a sweet little Victoria, drawn by two thoroughbred horses, to drive in the Bois de Boulogne, under the protection of an old woman, half companion and half servant, who was driven half mad by her charge's caprices. As yet her father has never denied her anything. He worked harder than all his clerks put together, for, after having spent the morning in his counting house over his papers, he received all business clients.  On the day after Flavia and Paul Violaine had met at Van Klopen's, M. Martin Rigal was, at about half-past five, closeted with one of his female clients. She was young, very pretty, and dressed with simple elegance, but the expression of her face was profoundly melancholy. Her eyes were overflowing with tears, which she made vain efforts to restrain.  \"If you refuse to renew our bill, sir, we are ruined,\" said she. \"I could meet it in January. I have sold all my trinkets, and we are existing on credit.\"  \"Poor little thing!\" interrupted the banker.  Her hopes grew under these words of pity.  \"And yet,\" continued she, \"business has never been so brisk. New customers are constantly coming in, and though our profits are small, the returns are rapid.\"  As Martin Rigal heard her exposition of the state of affairs, he nodded gravely.  \"That is all very well,\" said he at last, \"but this does not make the security you offer me of any more value. I have more confidence in you.\"  \"But remember, sir, that we have thirty thousand francs' worth of stock.\"  \"That is not what I was alluding to,\" and the banker accompanied these words with so meaning a look, that the poor woman blushed scarlet and almost lost her nerve. \"Your stock,\" said he, \"is of no more value in my eyes than the bill you offer me. Suppose, for instance, you were to become bankrupt, the landlord might come down upon everything, for he has great power.\"  He broke off abruptly, for Flavia's maid, as a privileged person, entered the room without knocking.  \"Sir,\" said she, \"my mistress wishes to see you at once.\"  The banker got up directly. \"I am coming,\" said he; then, taking the hand of his client, he led her to the door, repeating: \"Do not worry yourself; all the difficulties shall be got through. Come again, and we will talk them over;\" and before she could thank him he was half way to his daughter's apartment. Flavia had summoned her father to show him a new costume which had just been sent home by Van Klopen, and which pleased her greatly. Flavia's costume was a masterpiece of fashionable bad taste, which makes women look all alike and destroys all appearance of individuality. It was a mass of frills, furbelows, fringes, and flutings of rare hue and form, making a series of wonderful contrasts. Standing in the middle of the room, with every available candle alight, for the day was fading away, she was so dainty and pretty that even the _bizarre_ dress of Van Klopen's was unable to spoil her appearance. As she turned round, she caught sight of her father in a mirror, panting with the haste he had made in running upstairs.  \"What a time you have been!\" said she pettishly.  \"I was with a client,\" returned he apologetically.  \"You ought to have got rid of him at once. But never mind that; look at me and tell me plainly what you think of me.\"  She had no need to put the question, for the most intense admiration beamed in his face.  \"Exquisite, delicious, heavenly!\" answered he.  Flavia, accustomed as she was to her father's compliments, was highly delighted. \"Then you think that he will like me?\" asked she.  She alluded to Paul Violaine, and the banker heaved a deep sigh as he replied,--  \"Is it possible that any human being exists that you cannot please?\"  \"Ah!\" mused she, \"if it were any one but he, I should have no doubts or misgivings.\"  Martin Rigal took a seat near the fire, and, drawing his daughter to him, pressed a fond kiss upon her brow, while she with the grace and activity of a cat, nestled upon his knee. \"Suppose, after all, that he should not like me,\" murmured she; \"I should die of grief.\"  The banker turned away his face to hide the gloom that overspread it. \"Do you love him, then, even now?\" asked he.  She paused for a moment, and he added, \"More than you do me?\"  Flavia pressed her father's hand between both her palms and answered with a musical laugh, \"How silly you are, papa! Why, of course I love you. Are you not my father? I love you too because you are kind and do all I wish, and because you are always telling me that you love me. Because you are like the cupids in the fairy stories--dear old people who give their children all their heart's desire; I love you for my carriage, my horses, and my lovely dresses; for my purse filled with gold, for my beautiful jewelry, and for all the lovely presents you make me.\"  Every word she spoke betrayed the utter selfishness of her soul, and yet her father listened with a fixed smile of delight on his face.  \"And why do you love him?\" asked he.  \"Because--because,\" stammered the girl, \"first, because he is himself; and then,--well, I can't say, but I _do_ love him.\"  Her accents betrayed such depth of passion that the father uttered a groan of anguish.  Flavia caught the expression of his features, and burst into a fit of laughter.  \"I really believe that you are jealous,\" said she, as if she were speaking to a spoiled child. \"That is very naughty of you; you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I tell you that the first time I set eyes upon him at Van Klopen's, I felt a thrill of love pierce through my heart, such love as I never felt for a human being before. Since then, I have known no rest. I cannot sleep, and instead of blood, liquid fire seems to come through my veins.\"  Martin Rigal raised his eyes to the ceiling in mute surprise at this outburst of feeling.  \"You do not understand me,\" went on Flavia. \"You are the best of fathers, but, after all, you are but a man. Had I a mother, she would comprehend me better.\"  \"What could your mother have done for you more than I? Have I neglected anything for your happiness?\" asked the banker, with a sigh.  \"Perhaps nothing; for there are times when I hardly understand my own feelings.\"  In gloomy silence the banker listened to the narrative of his daughter's state of mind; then he said,--  \"All shall be as you desire, and the man you love shall be your husband.\"  The girl was almost beside herself with joy, and, throwing her arms around his neck, pressed kiss upon kiss on his cheeks and forehead.  \"Darling,\" said she, \"I love you for this more than for anything that you have given me in my life.\"  The banker sighed again; and Flavia, shaking her pretty little fist at him, exclaimed, \"What is the meaning of that sigh, sir? Do you by any chance regret your promise? But never mind that. How do you mean to bring him here without causing any suspicion?\"  A benevolent smile passed over her father's face, as he answered,--  \"That, my pet, is my secret.\"  \"Very well, keep it; I do not care what means you use, as long as I see him soon, very soon,--to-night perhaps, in an hour, or even in a few minutes. You say Dr. Hortebise will bring him here; he will sit at our table. I can look at him without trouble, I shall hear his voice--\"  \"Silly little puss!\" broke in the banker; \"or, rather, I should say, unhappy child.\"  \"Silly, perhaps; but why should you say unhappy?\"  \"You love him too fondly, and he will take advantage of your feeling for him.\"  \"Never; I do not believe it,\" answered the girl.  \"I hope to heaven, darling, that my fears may never be realized. But he is not the sort of husband that I intended for you; he is a composer.\"  \"And is that anything against him!\" exclaimed Flavia in angry tones; \"one would think from your sneers that this was a crime. Not only is he a composer, but he is a genius. I can read that in his face. He may be poor, but I am rich enough for both, and he will owe all to me; so much the better, for then he will not be compelled to give lessons for his livelihood, and he will have leisure to compose an opera more beautiful than any that Gounod has ever written, and I shall share all his glory. Why, perhaps, he may even sing his own songs to me alone.\"  Her father noticed her state of feverish excitement and gazed upon her sadly. Flavia's mother had been removed from this world at the early age of twenty-four by that insidious malady, consumption, which defies modern medical science, and in a brief space changes a beautiful girl into a livid corpse, and the father viewed her excited manner, flushed cheeks, and sparkling eyes with tears and dismay.  \"By heavens!\" cried he, bursting into a sudden fit of passion; \"if ever he ill treats you, he is a dead man.\"  The girl was startled at the sudden ferocity of his manner.  \"What have I done to make you angry?\" asked she; \"and why do you have such evil thoughts of him?\"  \"I tremble for you, in whom my whole soul is wrapped up,\" answered the banker. \"This man has robbed me of my child's heart, and you will be happier with him than you are with your poor old father. I tremble because of your inexperience and his weakness, which may prove a source of trouble to you.\"  \"If he is weak, all the better; my will can guide him.\"  \"You are wrong,\" replied her father, \"as many other women have been before you. You believe that weak and vacillating dispositions are easily controlled, but I tell you that this is an error. Only determined characters can be influenced, and it is on substantial foundations that we find support.\"  Flavia made no reply, and her father drew her closer to him.  \"Listen to me, my child,\" said he. \"You will never have a better friend than I am. You know that I would shed every drop of blood in my veins for you. He is coming, so search your heart to discover if this is not some mere passing fancy.\"  \"Father!\" cried she.  \"Remember that your happiness is in your own hands now, so be careful and conceal your feelings, and do not let him discover how deep your love is for him. Men's minds are so formed that while they blame a woman for duplicity, they complain far more if she acts openly and allows her feelings to be seen----\"  He paused, for the door-bell rang. Flavia's heart gave a bound of intense joy.  \"He has come!\" gasped she, and, with a strong effort to retain her composure, she added, \"I will obey you, my dear father; I will not come here again until I have entirely regained my composure. Do not fear, and I will show you that your daughter can act a part as well as any other woman.\"  She fled from the room as the door opened, but it was not Paul who made his appearance, but some other guests--a stout manufacturer and his wife, the latter gorgeously dressed, but with scarcely a word to say for herself. For this evening the banker had issued invitations to twenty of his friends, and among this number Paul would scarcely be noticed. He in due time made his appearance with Dr. Hortebise, who had volunteered to introduce him into good society. Paul felt ill at ease; he had just come from the hands of a fashionable tailor, who, thanks to Mascarin's influence, had in forty-eight hours prepared an evening suit of such superior cut that the young man hardly knew himself in it. Paul had suffered a good deal from conflicting emotions after the visit to Van Klopen's, and more than once regretted the adhesion that he had given to Mascarin's scheme; but a visit the next day from Hortebise, and the knowledge that the fashionable physician was one of the confederates, had reconciled him to the position he had promised to assume.  He was moreover struck with Flavia's charms, and dazzled with the accounts of her vast prospective fortune. To him, Hortebise, gay, rich, and careless, seemed the incarnation of happiness, and contributed greatly to stifle the voice of Paul's conscience. He would, however, perhaps have hesitated had he known what the locket contained that dangled so ostentatiously from the doctor's chain.  Before they reached the banker's door, driven in the doctor's elegant brougham, a similar one to which Paul mentally declared he would have, as soon as circumstances would permit, the young man's mentor spoke.  \"Let me say a few words to you. You have before you a chance which is seldom afforded to any young man, whatever his rank and social standing. Mind that you profit by it.\"  \"You may be sure I will,\" said Paul, with a smile of self-complacency.  \"Good, dear boy; but let me fortify your courage with a little of my experience. Do you know what an heiress really is?\"  \"Well, really----\"  \"Permit me to continue. An heiress and more so if she is an only child, is generally a very disagreeable person, headstrong, capricious, and puffed up with her own importance. She is utterly spoiled by the flattery to which she has been accustomed from her earliest years, and thinks that all the world is made to bend before her.\"  \"Ah!\" answered Paul, a little discomfited. \"I hope it is not Mademoiselle Flavia's portrait that you have been sketching?\"  \"Not exactly,\" answered the doctor, with a laugh. \"But I must warn you that even she has certain whims and fancies. For instance, I am quite sure that she would give a suitor every encouragement, and then repulse him without rhyme or reason.\"  Paul, who up to this time had only seen the bright side of affairs, was a good deal disconcerted.  \"Buy why should you introduce me to her then?\"  \"In order that you may win her. Have you not everything to insure success? She will most likely receive you with the utmost cordiality; but beware of being too sanguine. Even if she makes desperate love to you, I say, take care; it may be only a trap; for, between ourselves, a girl who has a million stitched to her petticoats is to be excused if she endeavors to find out whether the suitor is after her or her money.\"  Just then the brougham stopped, and Dr. Hortebise and his young friend entered the house in the Rue Montmartre, where they were cordially greeted by the banker.  Paul glanced round, but there were no signs of Flavia, nor did she make her appearance until five minutes before the dinner hour, when the guests flocked round her. She had subdued all her emotions, and not a quiver of the eyelids disclosed the excitement under which she was laboring. Her eye rested on Paul, and he bowed ceremoniously. The banker was delighted, for he had not believed much in her self-command. But Flavia had taken his advice to heart, and when seated at table abstained from casting a glance in Paul's direction. When dinner was over and many of the guests had sat down to whist; Flavia ventured to approach Paul, and in a low voice, which shook a little in spite of her efforts, said,--  \"Will you not play me one of your own compositions, M. Violaine?\"  Paul was but a medium performer, but Flavia seemed in the seventh heaven, while her father and Dr. Hortebise, who had taken their seats not far away, watched the young couple with much anxiety.  \"How she adores him!\" whispered the banker. \"And yet I cannot judge of the effect that she has produced upon him.\"  \"Surely Mascarin will worm it all out of him to-morrow,\" returned the doctor. \"To-morrow the poor fellow will have his hands full, for there is to be a general meeting, when we shall hear all about Catenac's ideas, and I shall be glad to know what Croisenois's conduct will be when he knows what he is wanted for.\"  It was growing late, and the guests began to drop off. Dr. Hortebise signalled to Paul, and they left the house together. According to the promise to her father, Flavia had acted her part so well, that Paul did not know whether he had made an impression or not.    CHAPTER XV.  MASTER CHUPIN.  Beaumarchef, when Mascarin called a general meeting of his associates, was in the habit of assuming his very best attire; for as he was often called into the inner office to answer questions, he was much impressed with the importance of the occasion. This time, however, the subordinate, although he had received due notice of the meeting, was still in his every-day dress. This discomposed him a good deal, though he kept muttering to himself that he meant no disrespect by it. Early in the morning he had been compelled to make up the accounts of two cooks, who, having obtained situations, were leaving the servants' lodging-house. When this matter was completed, he had hoped for half an hour's leisure. As he was crossing the courtyard, however, he fell in with Toto Chupin bringing in his daily report, which Beaumarchef thought would be what it usually was--a mere matter of form. He was, however, much mistaken; for though outwardly Toto was the same, yet his ideas had taken an entirely new direction; and when Beaumarchef urged him to look sharp, the request was received with a great deal of sullenness.  \"I ain't lost no time,\" said he, \"and have fished up a thing or two fresh; but before saying a word--\"  He stopped, and seemed a little confused.  \"Well, go on.\"  \"I want a fresh arrangement.\"  Beaumarchef was staggered.  \"Arrangement!\" he echoed.  \"Of course you can lump it if yer don't like it,\" said the boy. \"Do you think as how I'm going to work like a horse, and not get a wink of sleep, just for a 'thank ye, Chupin?' No fear. I'm worth a sight more nor that.\"  Beaumarchef flew into a rage.  \"Then you are not worth a pinch of salt,\" said he.  \"All right, my cove.\"  \"And you are an ungrateful young villain to talk like this after all the kindness your master has shown you.\"  Chupin gave a sarcastic laugh.  \"Goodness!\" cried he. \"To hear you go on, one would think that the boss had ruined himself for my sake.\"  \"He took you out of the streets, and has given you a room ever since.\"  \"A room, do you say? I call it a dog kennel.\"  \"You have your breakfast and dinner every day regularly.\"  \"I know that, and half a bottle of wine at each meal, which has so much water in it that it cannot even stain the tablecloth.\"  \"You are an ungrateful young hound,\" exclaimed Beaumarchef, \"and forget that, in addition to this, he has set you up in business as a hot chestnut seller.\"  \"Good old business! I am allowed to stand all day under the gateway, roasted on one side, and frozen on the other, and gain, perhaps twenty sous.\"  \"You know that in summer he has promised to set you up in the fried potato line.\"  \"Thank ye for nothing; I don't like the smell of grease.\"  \"What is it you want, then?\"  \"Nothing. I feels that I ought to be a gentleman at large.\"  Beaumarchef cast a furious glance at the shameless youth, and told him that he would report everything to his master. The boy, however, did not seem to care a pin.  \"I intends to see Master Mascarin myself presently,\" remarked Chupin.  \"You are an idiot.\"  \"Why so? Do you think I didn't live better before I had anything to do with this blooming old cove? I never worked then. I used to sing in front of the pubs, and easily made my three francs a day. My pal and I soon check 'em though, and then off we went to the theatre. Sometimes we'd make tracks for Ivry, and take our doss in a deserted factory, into which the crushers never put their noses. In the winter we used to go to the glass houses and sleep in the warm ashes. All these were good times, while now--\"  \"Well, what have you to grumble at now? Don't I hand you a five-franc piece every day that you are at work?\"  \"But that ain't good enough. Come, don't get shirty; all I asks is a rise of salary. Only say either Yes or No; and if you say No, why, I sends in my resignation.\"  Beaumarchef would have given a five-franc piece out of his own pocket for Mascarin to have heard the boy's impertinence.  \"You are a young rascal!\" said he, \"and keep the worst of company. There is no use in denying it, for a hang-dog fellow, calling himself Polyte, has been here asking after you.\"  \"My company ain't any business of yours.\"  \"Well, I give you warning, you will come to grief.\"  \"How?\" returned Toto Chupin sulkily. \"How can I come to grief? If old Mascarin interferes, I'll shut up his mouth pretty sharp. I wish you and your master wouldn't poke their noses into my affairs. I'm sick of you both. Don't you think I'm up to you? When you make me follow some one for a week at a time, it isn't to do 'em a kindness, I reckon. If things turn out badly, I've only to go before a beak and speak up; I should get off easily enough then; and if I do so, you will be sorry for not having given me more than my five francs a day.\"  Beaumarchef was an old soldier and a bold man, but he was easily upset, for the lad's insolence made him believe that he was uttering words that had been put in his mouth by some wily adviser; and not knowing how to act, the ex-soldier thought it best to adopt a more conciliating demeanor.  \"How much do you want?\" asked he.  \"Well, seven francs to start with.\"  \"The deuce you do! Seven francs a day is a sum. Well, I'll give it you myself to-day and will speak about you to the master.\"  \"You won't get me to loosen my tongue for that amount to-day; you may bet your boots on that,\" answered the lad insolently. \"I wants one hundred francs down on the nail.\"  \"One hundred francs,\" echoed Beaumarchef, scandalized at such a demand.  \"Yes, my cove, that and no less.\"  \"And what will you give in return? No, no, my lad; your demand is a preposterous one; besides, you wouldn't know how to spend such a sum.\"  \"Don't you flurry yourself about that; but of one thing you may be sure, I sha'n't spend my wages as you do--in wax for your mustache.\"  Beaumarchef could not endure an insult to his mustache, and Chupin was about to receive the kick he had so richly earned, when Daddy Tantaine suddenly made his appearance, looking exactly as he did when he visited Paul in his garret.  \"Tut, tut; never quarrel with the door open.\"  Beaumarchef thanked Providence for sending this sudden reinforcement to his aid, and began in a tone of indignation,--  \"Toto Chupin--\"  \"Stop! I have heard every word,\" broke in Tantaine.  On hearing this, Toto felt that he had better make himself scarce; for though he hardly knew Mascarin, and utterly despised Beaumarchef, he trembled before the oily Tantaine, for in him he recognized a being who would stand no nonsense. He therefore began in an apologetic tone,--  \"Just let me speak, sir; I only wanted--\"  \"Money, of course, and very natural too. Come, Beaumarchef, hand this worthy lad the hundred francs that he has so politely asked for.\"  Beaumarchef was utterly stupefied, and was about to make some objection when he was struck by a signal which Toto did not perceive, and, drawing out his pocketbook, extracted a note which he offered to the lad. Toto glanced at the note, then at the faces of the two men, but was evidently afraid to take the money.  \"Take the money,\" said Tantaine. \"If your information is not worth the money, I will have it back from you; come into the office, where we shall not be disturbed.\"  Tantaine took a chair, and glancing at Toto, who stood before him twirling his cap leisurely, said,--  \"I heard you.\"  The lad had by this time recovered his customary audacity.  \"Five days ago,\" he began, \"I was put on to Caroline Schimmel; I have found out all about her by this time. She is as regular as clockwork in her duties at least. She wakes at ten and takes her absinthe. Then she goes to a little restaurant she knows, and has her breakfast and a game at cards with any one that will play with her. At six in the evening she goes to the Grand Turk, a restaurant and dancing-shop in the Rue des Poisonnieres. Ain't it a swell ken just! You can eat; drink, dance, or sing, just as you like; but you must have decent togs on, or they won't let you in.\"  \"Wouldn't they let you through then?\"  Toto pointed significantly to his rags as he replied,--  \"This rig out wouldn't pass muster, but I have a scheme in hand.\"  Tantaine took down the address of the dancing-saloon, and then, addressing Toto with the utmost severity,--  \"Do you think,\" said he, \"that this report is worth a hundred francs?\"  Toto made a quaint grimace.  \"Do you think,\" asked he, \"that Caroline can lead the life she does without money? No fear. Well, I have found out where the coin comes from.\"  The dim light in the office enabled Tantaine to hide the pleasure he felt on hearing these words.  \"Ah,\" answered he carelessly, as if it was a matter of but little moment, \"and so you have found out all that, have you?  \"Yes, and a heap besides. Just you listen. After her breakfast, my sweet Carry began to play cards with some chaps who had been grubbing at the next table. 'Regular right down card sharpers and macemen,' said I to myself, as I watched the way in which they faked the pasteboards. 'They'll get everything out of you, old gal.' I was in the right, for in less than an hour she had to go up to the counter and leave one of her rings as security for the breakfast. He said he knew her, and would give her credit. 'You are a trump,' said she. 'I'll just trot off to my own crib and get the money.'\"  \"Did she go home?\"  \"Not she; she went to a real swell house in a bang up part of Paris, the Rue de Varennes. She knocked at the door, and in she went, while I lounged about outside.\"  \"Do you know who lives there?\"  \"Of course I do. The grocer round the corner told me that it was inhabited by the Duke--what was his blessed name? Oh, the Duke----\"  \"Was it the Duke de Champdoce?\"  \"That is the right one, a chap they say as has his cellars chock full of gold and silver.\"  \"You are rather slow, my lad,\" said Tantaine, with his assumed air of indifference. \"Get on a bit, do.\"  Toto was much put out; for he had expected that his intelligence would have created an immense sensation.  \"Give a cove time to breathe in. Well, in half an hour out comes my Carry as lively as a flea. She got into a passing cab and away she went. Fortunately I can run a bit, and reached the Palais Royal in time to see Caroline change two notes of two hundred francs each at the money-changers.\"  \"How did you find out that?\"  \"By looking at 'em. The paper was yellow.\"  Tantaine smiled kindly. \"You know a banknote then?\"  \"Yes, but I have precious few chances of handling them. Once I went into a money-changer's shop and asked them just to let me feel one, and they said, 'Get out sharp.'\"  \"Is that all?\" demanded Tantaine.  \"No; I have kept the best bit for a finish. I want to tell you that there are others on the lookout after Caroline.\"  Toto had no reason this time to grumble at the effect he had produced, for the old man gave such a jump that his hat fell off.  \"What are you saying?\" said he.  \"Simply that for the last three days a big chap with a harp on his back has been keeping her in view. I twigged him at once, and he too saw her go into the swell crib that you say belongs to that Duke.\"  Tantaine pondered a little.  \"A street musician,\" muttered he. \"I must find out all about this. Now, Toto, listen to me; chuck Caroline over, and stick to the fellow with the harp; be off with you, for you have earned your money well.\"  As Chupin went off, the old man shook his head.  \"Too sharp by a good bit,\" said he; \"he won't have a long lease of life.\"  Beaumarchef was about to ask Tantaine to remain in the office while he went off to put on his best clothes, but the old man stopped this request by saying,--  \"As M. Mascarin does not like to be disturbed, I will just go in without knocking. When the other gentlemen arrive, show them in; for look you here, my good friend, the pear is so ripe that if it is not plucked, it will fall to the ground.\"    CHAPTER XVI.  A TURN OF THE SCREW.  Dr. Hortebise was the first to arrive. It was a terrible thing for him to get up so early; but for Mascarin's sake he consented even to this inconvenience. When he passed through the office, the room was full of clients; but this did not prevent the doctor from noticing the negligence of Beaumarchef's costume.  \"Aha!\" remarked the doctor, \"on the drunk again, I am afraid.\"  \"M. Mascarin is within,\" answered the badgered clerk, endeavoring to put on an air of dignity; \"and M. Tantaine is with him.\"  A brilliant idea flashed across the doctor's mind, but it was with an air of gravity that he said,--  \"I shall be charmed to meet that most worthy old gentleman.\"  When, however, he entered the inner sanctum, he found Mascarin alone, occupied in sorting the eternal pieces of pasteboard.  \"Well, what news?\" asked he.  \"There is none that I know of.\"  \"What, have you not seen Paul?\"  \"No.\"  \"Will he be here?\"  \"Certainly.\"  Mascarin was often laconic, but he seldom gave such short answers as this.  \"What is the matter?\" asked the doctor. \"Your greeting is quite funereal. Are you not well?\"  \"I am merely preoccupied, and that is excusable on the eve of the battle we are about to fight,\" returned Mascarin.  He only, however, told a portion of the truth; for there was more in the background, which he did not wish to confide to his friend. Toto Chupin's revolt had disquieted him. Let there be but a single flaw in the axletree, and one day it will snap in twain; and Mascarin wanted to eliminate this flaw.  \"Pooh!\" remarked the doctor, playing with his locket, \"we shall succeed. What have we to fear, after all,--opposition on Paul's part?\"  \"Paul may resent a little,\" answered Mascarin disdainfully; \"but I have decided that he shall be present at our meeting of to-day. It will be a stormy one, so be prepared. We might give him his medicine in minims, but I prefer the whole dose at once.\"  \"The deuce you do! Suppose he should be frightened, and make off with our secret.\"  \"He won't make off,\" replied Mascarin in a tone which froze his listener's blood. \"He can't escape from us any more than the cockchafer can from the string that a child has fastened to it. Do you not understand weak natures like his? He is the glove, I the strong hand beneath it.\"  The doctor did not argue this point, but merely murmured,--  \"Let us hope that it is so.\"  \"Should we have any opposition,\" resumed Mascarin, \"it will come from Catenac. I may be able to force him into co-operation with us, but his heart will not be in the enterprise.\"  \"Do you propose to bring Catenac into this affair?\" asked Hortebise in great surprise.  \"Assuredly.\"  \"Why have you changed your plan?\"  \"Simply because I have recognized the fact that, if we dispensed with his services, we should be entirely at the mercy of a shrewd man of business, because----\"  He broke off, listened for a moment, and then said,--  \"Hush! I can hear his footstep.\"  A dry cough was heard outside, and in another moment Catenac entered the room.  Nature, or profound dissimulation, had gifted Catenac with an exterior which made every one, when first introduced to him, exclaim, \"This is an honest and trustworthy man.\" Catenac always looked his clients boldly in the face. His voice was pleasant, and had a certain ring of joviality in it, and his manner was one of those easy ones which always insure popularity. He was looked upon as a shrewd lawyer; but yet he did not shine in court. He must therefore, to make those thirty thousand francs a year which he was credited with doing, have some special line of business. He assayed rather risky matters, which might bring both parties into the clutches of the criminal law, or, at any rate, leave them with a taint upon both their names. A sensational lawsuit is begun, and the public eagerly await the result; suddenly the whole thing collapses, for Catenac has acted as mediator. He has even settled the disputes of murderers quarreling over their booty. But he has even gone farther than this. More than once he has said of himself, \"I have passed through the vilest masses of corruption.\" In his office in the Rue Jacob he has heard whispered conferences which were enough to bring down the roof above his head. Of course this was the most lucrative business that passed into Catenac's hands. The client conceals nothing from his attorney, and he belongs to him as absolutely as the sick man belongs to his physician or the penitent to his confessor.  \"Well, my dear Baptiste,\" said he, \"here I am; you summoned me, and I am obedient to the call.\"  \"Sit down,\" replied Mascarin gravely.  \"Thanks, my friend, many thanks, a thousand thanks; but I am much hurried; indeed I have not a moment to spare. I have matters on my hands of life and death.\"  \"But for all that,\" remarked Hortebise, \"you can sit down for a moment. Baptiste has something to say to you which is as important as any of your matters can be.\"  With a frank and genial smile Catenac obeyed; but in his heart were anger and an abject feeling of alarm.  \"What is it that is so important?\" asked he.  Mascarin had risen and locked the door. When he had resumed his seat he said,--  \"The facts are very simple. Hortebise and I have decided to put our great plan into execution, which we have as yet only discussed generally with you. We have the Marquis de Croisenois with us.\"  \"My dear sir,\" broke in the lawyer.  \"Wait a little; we must have your assistance, and----\"  Catenac rose from his seat. \"That is enough,\" said he. \"You have made a very great mistake if it is on this matter that you have sent for me; I told you this before.\"  He was turning away, and looking for his hat, proposed to beat a retreat; but Dr. Hortebise stood between him and the door, gazing upon him with no friendly expression of countenance. Catenac was not a man to be easily alarmed, but the doctor's appearance was so threatening, and the smile upon Mascarin's lips was of so deadly a character, that he stood still, positively frightened into immobility.  \"What do you mean?\" stammered he; \"what is it you say now?\"  \"First,\" replied the doctor, speaking slowly and distinctly,--\"first, we wish that you should listen to us when we speak to you.\"  \"I am listening.\"  \"Then sit down again, and hear what Baptiste has to say.\"  The command Catenac had over his countenance was so great that it was impossible to see to what conclusion he had arrived from the words and manner of his confederates.  \"Then let Baptiste explain himself,\" said he.  \"Before entering into matters completely,\" said he coolly, \"I first want to ask our dear friend and associate if he is prepared to act with us?\"  \"Why should there be any doubt on that point?\" asked the lawyer. \"Do all my repeated assurances count as nothing?\"  \"We do not want promises now; what we do want is good faith and real co-operation.\"  \"Can it be that you--\"  \"I ought to inform you,\" continued Mascarin, unheeding the interruption, \"that we have every prospect of success; and, if we carry the matter through, we shall certainly have a million apiece.\"  Hortebise had not the calm patience of his confederate, and exclaimed,--  \"You understand it well enough. Say Yes or No.\"  Catenac was in the agonies of indecision, and for fully a minute made no reply.  \"_No_, then!\" he broke out in a manner which betrayed his intense agitation. \"After due consideration, and having carefully weighed the chances for and against, I answer you decidedly, No.\"  Mascarin and Hortebise evidently expected this reply, and exchanged glances.  \"Permit me to explain,\" said Catenac, \"what you consider as a cowardly withdrawal upon my part--\"  \"Call it treachery.\"  \"I will not quibble about words. I wish to be perfectly straightforward with you.\"  \"I am glad to hear it,\" sneered the doctor, \"though that is not your usual form.\"  \"And yet I do not think that I have ever concealed my real opinion from you. It is fully ten years ago since I spoke to you of the necessity of breaking up this association. Can you recall what I said? I said only our extreme need and griping poverty justified our acts. They are now inexcusable.\"  \"You talked very freely of your scruples,\" observed Mascarin.  \"You remember my words then?\"  \"Yes, and I remember too that those inner scruples never hindered you from drawing your share of the profits.\"  \"That is to say,\" burst in the doctor, \"you repudiated the work, but shared the booty. You wished to play the game without staking anything.\"  Catenac was in no way disconcerted at this trenchant argument.  \"Quite true,\" said he, \"I always received my share; but I have done quite as much as you in putting the agency in its present prosperous condition. Does it not work smoothly like a perfect piece of mechanism? Have we not succeeded in nearly all our schemes? The income comes in monthly with extreme regularity, and I, according to my rights, have received one-third. If you desire to throw up this perilous means of livelihood, say so, and I will not oppose it.\"  \"You are really too good,\" sneered the doctor, with a look of menace in his glance.  \"Nor,\" continued Catenac, \"will I oppose you if you prefer to let matters stand as they are; but if you start on fresh enterprises, and embark on the tempestuous sea of danger, then I put down my foot and very boldly 'halt.' I will not take another step with you. I can see by the looks of both of you that you think me a fool and a coward. Heaven grant that the future may not show you only too plainly that I have been in the right. Think over this. For twenty years fortune has favored us, but, believe me, it is never wise to tempt her too far, for it is well known that at some time or other she always turns.\"  \"Your imagery is really charming,\" remarked Hortebise sarcastically.  \"Good, I have nothing else to say but to repeat my warning: _reflect_. Grand as your hopes and expectations may be, they are as nothing to the perils that you will encounter.\"  This cold flood of eloquence was more than the doctor could bear.  \"It is all very well for you,\" exclaimed he, \"to reason like this, for you are a rich man.\"  \"I have enough to live on, I allow; for in addition to the income derived from my profession, I have saved two hundred thousand francs; and if you can be induced to renounce your projects, I will divide this sum with you. You have only to think.\"  Mascarin, who had taken no part in the dispute, now judged it time to interfere.  \"And so,\" said he, turning to Catenac, \"you have only two hundred thousand francs?\"  \"That or thereabouts.\"  \"And you offer to divide this sum with us. Really we ought to be deeply grateful to you, but----\"  Mascarin paused for a moment; then settling his spectacles more firmly, he went on,--  \"But even if you were to give us what you propose, you would still have eleven hundred thousand francs remaining!\"  Catenac burst into a pleasant laugh. \"You are jesting,\" said he.  \"I can prove the correctness of my assertion;\" and as he spoke, Mascarin unlocked a drawer, and taking a small notebook from it, turned over the pages, and leaving it open at a certain place, handed it to the lawyer.  \"There,\" said he, \"that is made up to December last, and shows precisely how you stand financially. Twice, then, you have increased your funds. These deposits you will find in an addenda at the end of the book.\"  Catenac started to his feet; all his calmness had now disappeared.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I have just the sum you name; and I, for that very reason, refuse to have anything further to do with your schemes. I have an income of sixty thousand francs; that is to say, sixty thousand good reasons for receiving no further risks. You envy me my good fortune, but did we not all start penniless? I have taken care of my money, while you have squandered yours. Hortebise has lost his patients, while I have increased the number of my clients; and now you want me to tread the dangerous road again. Not I; go your way, and leave me to go home.\"  Again he took up his hat, but a wave of the hand from Mascarin detained him.  \"Suppose,\" said he coldly, \"that I told you that your assistance was necessary to me.\"  \"I should say so much the worse for you.\"  \"But suppose I insist?\"  \"And how can you insist? We are both in the same boat, and sink or swim together.\"  \"Are you certain of that?\"  \"So certain that I repeat from this day I wash my hands of you.\"  \"I am afraid you are in error.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Because for twelve months past; I have given food and shelter to a girl of the name of Clarisse. Do you by any chance know her?\"  At the mention of this name, the lawyer started, as a man starts who, walking peacefully along, suddenly sees a deadly serpent coiled across his path.  \"Clarisse,\" stammered he, \"how did you know of her? who told you?\"  But the sarcastic sneer upon the lips of his two confederates wounded his pride so deeply, that in an instant he recovered his self-possession.  \"I am getting foolish,\" said he, \"to ask these men how they learned my secret. Do they not always work by infamous and underhand means?\"  \"You see I know all,\" remarked Mascarin, \"for I foresaw the day would come when you would wish to sever our connection, and even give us up to justice, if you could do so with safety to yourself. I therefore took my precautions. One thing, however, I was not prepared for, and that was, that a man of your intelligence should have played so paltry a game, and even twelve months back thought of betraying us. It is almost incredible. Do you ever read the _Gazette des Tribunaux_? I saw in its pages yesterday a story nearly similar to your own. Shall I tell it to you? A lawyer who concealed his vices beneath a mantle of joviality and candor, brought up from the country a pretty, innocent girl to act as servant in his house. This lawyer occupied his leisure time in leading the poor child astray, and the moment at last came when the consequences of her weakness were too apparent. The lawyer was half beside himself at the approaching scandal. What would the neighbors say? Well, to cut the story short, the infant was suppressed,--you understand, suppressed, and the mother turned into the street.\"  \"Baptiste, have mercy!\"  \"It was a most imprudent act, for such things always leak out somehow. You have a gardener at your house at Champigny, and suppose the idea seized upon this worthy man to dig up the ground round the wall at the end of the garden.\"  \"That is enough,\" said Catenac, piteously. \"I give in.\"  Mascarin adjusted his spectacles, as he always did in important moments.  \"You give in, do you? Not a bit. Even now you are endeavoring to find a means of parrying my home thrusts.\"  \"But I declare to you----\"  \"Do not be alarmed; dig as deeply as he might, your gardener would discover nothing.\"  The lawyer uttered a stifled exclamation of rage as he perceived the pit into which he had fallen.  \"He would find nothing,\" resumed Mascarin, \"and yet the story is all true. Last January, on a bitterly cold night, you dug a hole, and in it deposited the body of a new-born infant wrapped in a shawl. And what shawl? Why the very one that you purchased at the _Bon Marche_, when you were making yourself agreeable to Clarisse. The shopman who sold it to you has identified it, and is ready to give evidence when called upon. You may look for that shawl, Catenac, but you will not find it.\"  \"Have you got that shawl?\" asked Catenac hoarsely.  \"Am I a fool?\" asked Mascarin contemptuously. \"Tantaine has it; but _I_ know where the body is, and will keep the information to myself. Do not be alarmed; act fairly, and you are safe; but make one treacherous move, and you will read in the next day's papers a paragraph something to this effect: 'Yesterday some workmen, engaged in excavations near so-and-so, discovered the body of a new-born infant. Every effort is being made to discover the author of the crime.' You know me, and that I work promptly. To the shawl I have added a handkerchief and a few other articles belonging to Clarisse, which will render it an easy matter to fix the guilt on you.\"  Catenac was absolutely stunned, and had lost all power of defending himself. The few incoherent words that he uttered showed his state of utter despair.  \"You have killed me,\" gasped he, \"just as the prize, that I have been looking for for twenty years, was in my grasp.\"  \"Work does a man no harm,\" remarked the doctor sententiously.  There was, however, little time to lose; the Marquis de Croisenois and Paul might be expected to arrive at any moment, and Mascarin hastened to restore a certain amount of calmness to his prostrate antagonist.  \"You make as much noise as if we were going to hand you over to the executioner on the spot. Do you think that we are such a pair of fools as to risk all these hazards without some almost certain chance of success? Hortebise was as much startled as yourself when I first spoke to him of this affair, but I explained everything fully to him, and now he is quite enthusiastic in the matter. Of course you can lay aside all fear, and, as a man of the world, will bear no malice against those who have simply played a better game than yourself.\"  \"Go on,\" said Catenac, forcing a smile, \"I am listening.\"  Mascarin made a short pause.  \"What we want of you,\" answered he, \"will not compromise you in the slightest degree. I wish you to draw up a document, the particulars of which I will give you presently, and you will outwardly have no connection with the matter.\"  \"Very good.\"  \"But there is more yet. The Duke of Champdoce has placed a difficult task in your hands. You are engaged in a secret on his behalf.\"  \"You know that also?\"  \"I know everything that may be made subservient to our ends. I also know that instead of coming direct to me you went to the very man that we have every reason to dread, that fellow Perpignan, who is nearly as sharp as we are.\"  \"Go on,\" returned Catenac impatiently. \"What do you expect from me on this point?\"  \"Not much; you must only come to me first, and report any discovery you may have made, and never give any information to the Duke without first consulting us.\"  \"I agree.\"  The contending parties seemed to have arrived at an amicable termination, and Dr. Hortebise smiled complacently.  \"Now,\" said he, \"shall we not confess, after all, that there was no use in making such a fuss?\"  \"I allow that I was in the wrong,\" answered Catenac meekly; and, extending his hands to his two associates with an oily smile, he said: \"Let us forget and forgive.\"  Was he to be trusted? Mascarin and the doctor exchanged glances of suspicion. A moment afterward a knock came to the door, and Paul entered, making a timid bow to his two patrons.  \"My dear boy,\" said Mascarin, \"let me present you to one of my oldest and best friends.\" Then, turning to Catenac, he added: \"I wish to ask you to help and assist my young friend here. Paul Violaine is a good fellow, who has neither father nor mother, and whom we are trying to help on in his journey through life.\"  The lawyer started as he caught the strange, meaning smile which accompanied these words.  \"Great heavens!\" said he, \"why did you not speak sooner?\"  Catenac at once divined Mascarin's project, and understood the allusion to the Duke de Champdoce.    CHAPTER XVII.  SOME SCRAPS OF PAPER.  The Marquis de Croisenois was never punctual. He had received a note asking him to call on Mascarin at eleven o'clock, and twelve had struck some time before he made his appearance. Faultlessly gloved, his glass firmly fixed in his eye, and a light walking cane in his hand, and with that air of half-veiled insolence that is sometimes affected by certain persons who wish the world to believe that they are of great importance, the Marquis de Croisenois entered the room.  At the age of twenty-five Henry de Croisenois affected the airs and manners of a lad of twenty, and so found many who looked upon his escapades with lenient eyes, ascribing them to the follies of youth. Under this youthful mask, however he concealed a most astute and cunning intellect, and had more than once got the better of the women with whom he had had dealings. His fortune was terribly involved, because he had insisted on living at the same rate as men who had ten times his income. Forming one of the recklessly extravagant band of which the Duke de Saumeine was the head, Croisenois, too, kept his racehorses, which was certainly the quickest way to wreck the most princely fortune. The Marquis had found out this, and was utterly involved, when Mascarin extended a helping hand to him, to which he clung with all the energy of a drowning man.  Whatever Henry de Croisenois' anxieties may have been on the day in question, he did not allow a symptom of them to appear, and on his entrance negligently drawled, \"I have kept you waiting, I fear; but really my time is not my own. I am quite at your service now, and will wait until these gentlemen have finished their business with you.\" And as he concluded, he again placed the cigar which he had removed while saying these words, to his lips.  His manner was very insolent, and yet the amiable Mascarin did not seem offended, although he loathed the scent of tobacco.  \"We had begun to despair of seeing you, Marquis,\" answered he politely. \"I say so, because these gentlemen are here to meet you. Permit me to introduce to you, Dr. Hortebise, M. Catenac of the Parisian bar, and our secretary,\" pointing as he spoke, to Paul.  As soon as Croisenois had taken his seat, Mascarin went straight to the point, as a bullet to the target. \"I do not intend,\" began he, \"to leave you in doubt for a moment. Beatings about the bush would be absurd among persons like ourselves.\"  At finding himself thus classed with the other persons present, the Marquis gave a little start, and then drawled out, \"You flatter me, really.\"  \"I may tell you, Marquis,\" resumed Mascarin, \"that your marriage has been definitely arranged by myself and my associates. All you have to do is to get the young lady's consent; for that of the Count and Countess has already been secured.\"  \"There will be no difficulty in that,\" lisped the Marquis. \"I will promise her the best horsed carriage in the Bois, a box at the opera, unlimited credit at Van Klopen's, and perfect freedom. There will be no difficulty, I assure you. Of course, however, I must be presented by some one who holds a good position in society.\"  \"Would the Viscountess de Bois Arden suit you?\"  \"No one better; she is a relation of the Count de Mussidan.\"  \"Good; then when you wish, Madame de Bois Arden will introduce you as a suitor for the young lady's hand, and praise you up to the skies.\"  The Marquis looked very jubilant at hearing this. \"All right,\" cried he; \"then that decides the matter.\"  Paul wondered whether he was awake or dreaming. He too had been promised a rich wife, and here was another man who was being provided for in the same manner. \"These people,\" muttered he, \"seem to keep a matrimonial agency as well as a servants' registry office!\"  \"All that is left, then,\" said the Marquis, \"is to arrange the--shall I call it the commission?\"  \"I was about to come to that,\" returned Mascarin.  \"Well, I will give you a fourth of the dowry, and on the day of my marriage will hand you a cheque for that amount.\"  Paul now imagined that he saw how matters worked. \"If I marry Flavia,\" thought he, \"I shall have to share her dowry with these highly respectable gentlemen.\"  The offer made by the Marquis did not, however, seem to please Mascarin. \"That is not what we want,\" said he.  \"No,--well, must I give you more? Say how much.\"  Mascarin shook his head.  \"Well then, I will give you a third; it is not worth while to give you more.\"  \"No, no; I would not take half, nor even the whole of the dowry. You may keep that as well as what you owe us.\"  \"Well, but tell me what you _do_ want.\"  \"I will do so,\" answered Mascarin, adjusting his spectacles carefully; \"but before doing so, I feel that I must give you a short account of the rise and progress of this association.\"  At this statement Hortebise and Catenac sprang to their feet in surprise and terror. \"Are you mad?\" said they at length, with one voice.  Mascarin shrugged his shoulders.  \"Not yet,\" answered he gently, \"and I beg that you will permit me to go on.\"  \"But surely we have some voice in the matter,\" faltered Catenac.  \"That is enough,\" exclaimed Mascarin angrily, \"Am not I the head of this association? Do you think,\" he continued in tones of deep sarcasm, \"that we cannot speak openly before the Marquis?\"  Hortebise and the lawyer resignedly resumed their seats. Croisenois thought that a word from him might reassure them.  \"Among honest men--\" began he.  \"We are not honest men,\" interrupted Mascarin. \"Sir,\" added he in a severe tone, \"nor are you either.\"  This plain speaking brought a bright flush to the face of the Marquis, who had half a mind to be angry, but policy restrained him, and he affected to look on the matter as a joke. \"Your joke is a little personal,\" said he.  But Mascarin took no heed of his remark. \"Listen to me,\" said he, \"for we have no time to waste, and do you,\" he added, turning to Paul, \"pay the greatest attention.\"  A moment of perfect silence ensued, broken only by the hum of voices in the outer office.  \"Marquis,\" said Mascarin, whose whole face blazed with a gleam of conscious power, \"twenty-five years ago I and my associates were young and in a very different position. We were honest then, and all the illusions of youth were in full force; we had faith and hope. We all then tenanted a wretched garret in the Rue de la Harpe, and loved each other like brothers.\"  \"That was long, long ago,\" murmured Hortebise.  \"Yes,\" rejoined Mascarin; \"and yet the effluxion of times does not hinder me from seeing things as they then were, and my heart aches as I compare the hopes of those days with the realities of the present. Then, Marquis, we were poor, miserably poor, and yet we all had vague hopes of future greatness.\"  Croisenois endeavored to conceal a sneer; the story was not a very interesting one.  \"As I said before, each one of us anticipated a brilliant career. Catenac had gained a prize by his 'Treatise on the Transfer of Real Estate,' and Hortebise had written a pamphlet regarding which the great Orfila had testified approval. Nor was I without my successes. Hortebise had unluckily quarrelled with his family. Catenac's relatives were poor, and I, well, I had no family. I stood alone. We were literally starving, and I was the only one earning money. I prepared pupils for the military colleges, but as I only earned twenty-five sous a day by cramming a dull boy's brain with algebra and geometry, that was not enough to feed us all. Well, to cut a long story short, the day came when we had not a coin among us. I forgot to tell you that I was devotedly attached to a young girl who was dying of consumption, and who had neither food nor fuel. What could I do? I knew not. Half mad, I rushed from the house, asking myself if I had better plead for charity or take the money I required by force from the first passer-by. I wandered along the quays, half inclined to confide my sorrow to the Seine, when suddenly I remembered it was a holiday at the Polytechnic School, and that if I went to the _Café Semblon_ or the Palais Royal, I should most likely meet with some of my old pupils, who could perhaps lend me a few sous. Five francs perhaps, Marquis,--that is a very small sum, but in that day it meant the life of my dear Marie and of my two friends. Have you ever been hungry, M. de Croisenois?\"  De Croisenois started; he had never suffered from hunger, but how could he tell what the future might bring? for his resources were so nearly exhausted, that even to-morrow he might be compelled to discard his fictitious splendor and sink into the abyss of poverty.  \"When I reached the _Café Semblon_,\" continued Mascarin, \"I could not see a single pupil, and the waiter to whom I addressed my inquiries looked at me with the utmost contempt, for my clothes were in tatters; but at length he condescended to inform me that the young gentlemen had been and gone, but that they would return. I said that I would wait for them. The man asked me if I would take anything, and when I replied in the negative, contemptuously pointed to a chair in a distant corner, where I patiently took my seat. I had sat for some time, when suddenly a young man entered the _café_, whose face, were I to live for a century, I shall never forget. He was perfectly livid, his features rigid, and his eyes wild and full of anguish. He was evidently in intense agony of mind or body. Evidently, however, it was not poverty that was oppressing him, for as he cast himself upon a sofa, all the waiters rushed forward to receive his orders. In a voice that was almost unintelligible, he asked for a bottle of brandy, and pen, ink, and paper. In some mysterious manner, the sight of this suffering brought balm to my aching heart. The order of the young man was soon executed, and pouring out a tumbler of brandy, he took a deep draught. The effect was instantaneous, he turned crimson, and for a moment almost fell back insensible. I kept my eyes on him, for a voice within me kept crying out that there was some mysterious link connecting this man and myself, and that his life was in some manner interwoven with mine, and that the influence he would exercise over me would be for evil. So strongly did this idea become rooted, that I should have left the _café_, had not my curiosity been so great. In the meantime the stranger had recovered himself, and seizing a pen, scrawled a few lines on a sheet of paper. Evidently he was not satisfied with his composition, for after reading it over, he lit a match and burnt the paper. He drank more brandy, and wrote a second letter, which, too, proved a failure, for he tore it to fragments, which he thrust into his waistcoat pocket. Again he commenced, using greater care. It was plain that he had forgotten where he was, for he gesticulated, uttered a broken sentence or two and evidently believed that he was in his own house. His last letter seemed to satisfy him, and he recopied it with care. He closed and directed it; then, tearing the original into pieces, he flung it under the table; then calling the waiter, he said, 'Here are twenty francs; take this letter to the address on the envelope. Bring the answer to my house; here is my card.' The man ran out of the room, and the nobleman, only waiting to pay his bill, followed almost immediately. The morsels of white paper beneath the table had a strange fascination for me; I longed to gather them up, to put them together, and to learn the secret of the strange drama that had been acted before me. But, as I have told you, then I was honest and virtuous, and the meanness of such an act revolted all my instincts; and I should have overcome this temptation, had it not been for one of those trifling incidents which too often form the turning-point of a life. A draught from a suddenly opened door caught one of these morsels of paper, and wafted it to my feet. I stooped and picked it up, and read on it the ominous words, 'blow out my brains!' I had not been mistaken, then, and was face to face with some coming tragedy. Having once yielded, I made no further efforts at self-control. The waiters were running about; no one paid any attention to me; and creeping to the place that the unknown had occupied, I obtained possession of two more scraps of paper. Upon one I read, 'shame and horror!' upon the other, 'one hundred thousand francs by to-night.' The meaning of these few words were as clear as daylight to me; but for all that, I managed to collect every atom of the torn paper, and piecing them together, read this:--  \"'CHARLES,--'I must have one hundred thousand francs to-night, and you are the only one to whom I can apply. The shame and horror of my position are too much for me. Can you send it me in two hours? As you act, so I regulate my conduct. I am either saved, or I blow out my brains.'  \"You are probably surprised, Marquis, at the accuracy of my memory, and even now I can see this scrawl as distinctly as if it were before me. At the end of this scrawl was a signature, one of the best known commercial names, which, in common with other financial houses, was struggling against a panic on the Bourse. My discovery disturbed me very much. I forgot all my miseries, and thought only of his. Were not our positions entirely similar? But by degrees a hideous temptation began to creep into my heart, and, as the minutes passed by, assume more vivid color and more tangible reality. Why should I not profit by this stolen secret? I went to the desk and asked for some wafers and a Directory. Then, returning, I fastened the torn fragments upon a clean sheet of paper, discovered the address of the writer, and then left the _café_. The house was situated in the Rue Chaussee d'Autin. For fully half an hour I paced up and down before his magnificent dwelling-place. Was he alive? Had the reply of Charles been in the affirmative? I decided at last to venture, and rang the bell. A liveried domestic appeared at my summons, and said that his master did not receive visitors at that hour; besides, he was at dinner. I was exasperated at the man's insolence, and replied hotly, 'If you want to save your master from a terrible misfortune, go and tell him that a man has brought him the rough draft of the letter he wrote a little time back at the _Café Semblon_.' The man obeyed me without a word, no doubt impressed by the earnestness of my manner. My message must have caused intense consternation, for in a moment the footman reappeared, and, in an obsequious manner, said, 'Follow at once, sir; my master is waiting for you.' He led me into a large room, magnificently furnished as a library, and in the centre of this room stood the man of the _Café Semblon_. His face was deadly pale, and his eyes blazed with fury. I was so agitated that I could hardly speak.  \"'You have picked up the scraps of paper I threw away?' exclaimed he.  \"I nodded, and showed him the fragments fastened on to the sheet of note-paper.  \"'How much do you want for that?' asked he. 'I will give you a thousand francs.'  \"I declare to you, gentlemen, that up to this time I had no intention of making money by the secret. My intention in going had been simply to say, 'I bring you this paper, of which some one else might have taken an undue advantage. I have done you a service; lend me a hundred francs.' This is what I meant to say, but his behavior irritated me, and I answered,--  \"'No, I want two thousand francs.'  \"He opened a drawer, drew out a bundle of banknotes, and threw them in my face.  \"'Pay yourself, you villain!' said he.  \"I can, I fear, never make you understand what I felt at this undeserved insult. I was not myself, and Heaven knows that I was not responsible for any crime that I might have committed in the frenzy of the moment, and I was nearly doing so. That man will, perhaps, never see death so near him, save at his last hour. On his writing table lay one of those Catalan daggers, which he evidently used as a paper-cutter. I snatched it up, and was about to strike, when the recollection of Marie dying of cold and starvation occurred to me. I dashed the knife to the ground, and rushed from the house in a state bordering on insanity. I went into that house an honest man, and left it a degraded scoundrel. But I must finish. When I reached the street, the two banknotes which I had taken from the packet seemed to burn me like coals of fire. I hastened to a money-changer, and got coin for them. I think, from my demeanor, he must have thought that I was insane. With my plunder weighing me down, I regained our wretched garret in the Rue de la Harpe. Catenac and Hortebise were waiting for me with the utmost anxiety. You remember that day, my friends. Marquis, my story is especially intended for you. As soon as I entered the room, my friends ran up to me, delighted at seeing me return in safety, but I thrust them aside.  \"'Let me alone!' cried I; 'I am no longer fit to take an honest man's hand; but we have money, money!' And I threw the bags upon the table. One of them burst, and a flood of silver coins rolled to every part of the room.  \"Marie started from her chair with upraised hands. 'Money!' she repeated, 'money! we shall have food, and I won't die.'  \"My friends, Marquis, were not as they are now, and they started back in horror, fearing that I had committed some crime.  \"'No,' said I, 'I have committed no crime, not one, at least, that will bring me within the reach of the strong arm of the law. This money is the price of our honor, but no one will know that fact but ourselves.'  \"Marquis, there was no sleeping in the garret all that night; but when daylight peered through the broken windows, it beamed on a table covered with empty bottles, and round it were seated three men, who, having cast aside all honorable scruples, had sworn that they would arrive at wealth and prosperity by any means, no matter how foul and treacherous they might be. That is all.\"    CHAPTER XVIII.  AN INFAMOUS TRADE.  Mascarin, who was anxious to make as deep an impression as possible upon Croisenois and Paul, broke off his story abruptly, and paced up and down the room. Had his intention been to startle his audience, he had most certainly succeeded. Paul was breathless with interest, and Croisenois broke down in attempting to make one of his usual trivial remarks. He was not particularly intelligent, except as regarded his self-interests, and though, of course, he knew that there must be some connection between his interests and the recital that Mascarin had just made, he could not for the life of him make out what it was. Mascarin seemed utterly careless of the effect that he had produced. But the next time that his walk brought him to his desk he stopped, and, adjusting his glasses, said, \"I trust, Marquis, that you will forgive this long preliminary address, which would really make a good sensational novel; but we have now arrived at the really practical part of the business.\" As he said these words, he took up an imposing attitude, with his elbow resting on the mantelpiece.  \"On the night of which I have spoken, I and my friends released ourselves from all the bonds of virtue and honor, and freed ourselves from all the fetters of duty to our fellow-men. The plan emanated from my brain complete in all its details in the will I made twenty years ago to my friends. Marquis, as the summer goes on, you know that the ripest and reddest cherries are the fullest flavored, just so, in the noblest and wealthiest of families in Paris there is not one that has not some terrible and ghostly secret which is sedulously concealed. Now, suppose that one man should gain possession of all of them, would he not be sole and absolute master? Would he not be more powerful than a despot on his throne? Would he not be able to sway society in any manner he might think fit? Well, I said to myself, I will be that man!\"  Ever since the Marquis had been in relation with Mascarin, he had shrewdly suspected that his business was not conducted on really fair principles.  \"What you mention,\" said he, \"is nothing but an elaborate and extended system of blackmail.\"  Mascarin bowed low, with an ironical smile on his face. \"Just so, Marquis, just so; you have hit on the very name. The word is modern, but the operation doubtless dates from the earliest ages. The day upon which one man began to trade upon the guilty secret of another was the date of the institution of this line of business. If antiquity makes a thing respectable, then blackmailing is worthy of great respect.\"  \"But, sir,\" said the Marquis, with a flush upon his face, \"but, sir--\"  \"Pshaw!\" broke in Mascarin, \"does a mere word frighten you? Who has not done some of it in his time? Why, look at yourself. Do you not recollect this winter that you detected a young man cheating at cards? You said nothing to him at the time, but you found out that he was rich, and, calling upon him the next day, borrowed ten thousand francs. When do you intend to repay that loan?\"  Croisenois sank back in his chair, overcome with surprise at this display of knowledge on Mascarin's part. \"This is too terrible,\" muttered he, but Mascarin went on,--  \"I know, at least, two thousand persons in Paris who only exist by the exercise of this profession; for I have studied them all, from the convict who screws money out of his former companions, in penal servitude, to the titled villain, who, having discovered the frailty of some unhappy woman, forces her to give him her daughter as his wife. I know a mere messenger in the Rue Douai, who in five years amassed a comfortable fortune. Can you guess how? When he was intrusted with a letter, he invariably opened it, and made himself master of its contents, and if there was a compromising word in it, he pounced down upon either the writer or the person to whom it was addressed. I also know of one large limited company which pays an annual income to a scoundrel with half a dozen foreign orders, who has found out that they have broken their statutes of association, and holds proofs of their having done so. But the police are on the alert, and our courts deal very severely with blackmailers.\"  Mascarin went on: \"The English, however, are our masters, for in London a compromising servant is as easily negotiable as a sound bill of exchange. There is in the city a respectable jeweller, who will advance money on any compromising letter with a good name at the foot. His shop is a regular pawnshop of infamy. In the States it has been elevated to the dignity of a profession, and the citizen at New York dreads the blackmailers more than the police, if he is meditating some dishonorable action. Our first operations did not bring in any quick returns, and the harvest promised to be a late one; but you have come upon us just as we are about to reap our harvest. The professions of Hortebise and Catenac--the one a doctor and the other a lawyer--facilitated our operations greatly. One administered to the diseases of the body, and the other to that of the purse, and, of course, thus they became professors of many secrets. As for me, the head and chief, it would not do to remain an idle looker-on. Our funds had dwindled down a good deal, and, after mature consideration, I decided to hire this house, and open a Servants' Registry Office. Such an occupation would not attract any attention, and in the end it turned out a perfect success, as my friends can testify.\"  Catenac and Hortebise both nodded assent.  \"By the system which I have adopted,\" resumed Mascarin, \"the wealthy and respectable man is as strictly watched in his own house as is the condemned wretch in his cell; for no act of his escapes the eyes of the servants whom we have placed around him. He can hardly even conceal his thoughts from us. Even the very secret that he has murmured to his wife with closed doors reaches our ears.\"  The Marquis gave a supercilious smile.  \"You must have had some inkling of this,\" observed Mascarin, \"for you have never taken a servant from our establishment; but for all that, I am as well posted up in your affairs as yourself. You have even now about you a valet of whom you know nothing.\"  \"Morel was recommended to me by one of my most intimate friends--Sir Richard Wakefield.\"  \"But for all that I have had my suspicions of him; but we will talk of this later, and we will now return to the subject upon which we have met. As I told you, I conceal the immense power I had attained through our agency, and use it as occasion presents itself, and after twenty years' patient labor, I am about to reap a stupendous harvest. The police pay enormous sums to their secret agents, while I, without opening my purse, have an army of devoted adherents. I see perhaps fifty servants of both sexes daily; calculate what this will amount to in a year.\"  There was an air of complacency about the man as he explained the working of his system, and a ring of triumph in his voice.  \"You must not think that all my agents are in my secrets, for the greater part of them are quite unaware of what they are doing, and in this lies my strength. Each of them brings me a slender thread, which I twine into the mighty cord by which I hold my slaves. These unsuspecting agents remind me of those strange Brazilian birds, whose presence is a sure sign that water is to be found near at hand. When one of them utters a note, I dig, and I find. And now, Marquis, do you understand the aim and end of our association?\"  \"It has,\" remarked Hortebise quietly, \"brought us in some years two hundred and fifty thousand francs apiece.\"  If M. de Croisenois disliked prosy tales, he by no means underrated the eloquence of figures. He knew quite enough of Paris to understand that if Mascarin threw his net regularly, he would infallibly catch many fish. With this conviction firmly implanted in his mind, he did not require much urging to look with favor on the scheme, and, putting on a gracious smile, he now asked, \"And what must I do to deserve admission into this association?\"  Paul had listened in wonder and terror, but by degrees all feelings of disgust at the criminality of these men faded away before the power that they unquestionably possessed.  \"If,\" resumed Mascarin, \"we have up to this met with no serious obstacles, it is because, though apparently acting rashly, we are in reality most prudent and cautious. We have managed our slaves well, and have not driven any one to desperation. But we are beginning to weary of our profession; we are getting old, and we have need of repose. We intend, therefore, to retire, but before that we wish to have all matters securely settled. I have an immense mass of documentary evidence, but it is not always easy to realize the value they represent, and I wait upon your assistance to enable me to do so.\"  Croisenois' face fell. Was he to take compromising letters round to his acquaintances and boldly say, \"Your purse or your honor?\" He had no objection to share the profits of this ignoble trade, but he objected strongly to showing his connection with it openly. \"No, no,\" cried he hastily, \"you must not depend upon me.\"  He seemed so much in earnest that Hortebise and Catenac exchanged glances of dismay.  \"Let us have no nonsense,\" returned Mascarin sternly, \"and wait a little before you display so much fierceness. I told you that my documentary evidence was of a peculiar kind. We very often had among our fish married people who cannot deal with their personal property. A husband, for instance, will say, 'I can't take ten thousand francs without my wife, knowing of it.' Women say, 'Why, I get all my money through my husband,' and both are telling the truth. They kneel at my feet and entreat me to have mercy, saying, 'Find me some excuse for using a portion of my funds and you shall have more than you ask.' For a long time I have sought for this means, and at last I have found it in the Limited Company, which you, Marquis, will float next month.\"  \"Really!\" returned the Marquis. \"I do not see--\"  \"I beg your pardon; you see it all clearly. A husband who cannot, without fear of disturbing his domestic peace, put in five thousand francs, can put in ten thousand if he tells his wife, 'It is an investment;' and many a wife who has not any money of her own will persuade her husband to bring in the money we require by the proposal to take shares. Now, what do you say to the idea?\"  \"I think that it is an excellent one, but what part am I to play in it?\"  \"In taking the part of Chairman of the Company. I could not do so, being merely the proprietor of a Servant's Registry Office. Hortebise, as a doctor, and more than all a homeopath, would inspire no confidence, and Catenac's legal profession prevents him appearing in the matter openly. He will act as our legal adviser.\"  \"But really I do not see anything about me that would induce people to invest,\" remarked De Croisenois.  \"You are too modest; you have your name and rank, which, however we may look upon them, have a great effect upon the general public. There are many Companies who pay directors of rank and credible connection very largely. Before starting this enterprise you can settle all your debts, and the world will then conclude that you are possessed of great wealth, while, at the same time, the news of your approaching marriage with Mademoiselle du Mussidan will be the general talk of society. What better position could you be in?\"  \"But I have the reputation of being a reckless spendthrift.\"  \"All the better. The day the prospectus comes out with your name at the head of it, there will be a universal burst of laughter. Men will say, 'Do you see what Croisenois is at now? What on earth possessed him to go into Company work?' But as this proceeding on your part will have paid your debts and given you Mademoiselle Sabine's dowry, I think that the laugh will be on your side.\"  The prospect dazzled Des Croisenois.  \"And suppose I accept,\" asked he, \"what will be the end of the farce?\"  \"Very simple. When all the shares are taken up, you will close the office and let the Company look after itself.\"  Croisenois started to his feet angrily. \"Why,\" cried he, \"you intend to make a catspaw of me! Such a proceeding would send me to penal servitude.\"  \"What an ungrateful man he is!\" said Mascarin, appealing to his audience, \"when I am doing all I can to prevent his going there.\"  \"Sir!\"  But Catenac now felt it time to interfere. \"You do not understand,\" remarked he, addressing Croisenois. \"You will start a Company for the development of some native product, let us say Pyrenean marble, for instance, issue a prospectus, and the shares will be at once taken up by Mascarin's clients.\"  \"Well, what happens then?\"  \"Why, out of the funds thus obtained we will take care when the crash comes to reimburse any outsiders who may have taken shares in the concern, telling them that the thing has been a failure, and that we are ruined; while Mascarin will take care to obtain from all his clients a discharge in full, so the Company will quietly collapse.\"  \"But,\" objected the Marquis, \"all the shareholders will know that I am a rogue.\"  \"Naturally.\"  \"They would hold me in utter contempt.\"  \"Perhaps so, but they would never venture to let you see it. I never thought that you would make objections; and whose character, however deep, will bear investigation?\"  \"Are you sure that you hold your people securely?\" asked he; \"and that none of them will turn surly?\"  Mascarin was waiting for this question, and taking from his desk the pieces of cardboard which he took so much pains to arrange, he replied, \"I have here the names of three hundred and fifty people who will each invest ten thousand francs in the Company. Listen to me, and judge for yourself.\"  He put all three pieces of cardboard together, and then drawing out one he read,--  \"'N---, civil engineer. Five letters written by him to the gentleman who procured his appointment for him: worth fifteen thousand francs.'  \"'P---, merchant. Absolute proof that his last bankruptcy was a fraudulent one, and that he kept back from his creditors two hundred thousand francs. Good for twenty thousand francs.'  \"'Madame V---. A photograph taken in very light and airy costume. Poor, but can pay three thousand francs.'  \"'M. H---. Three letters from her mother, proving that the daughter had compromised herself before marriage. Letter from a monthly nurse appended. Can be made to pay ten thousand francs.'  \"'X---, a portion of his correspondence with L--- in 1848. Three thousand francs.'  \"'Madame M. de M---. A true history of her adventure with M. J---.'\"  This sample was quite sufficient to satisfy M. de Croisenois. \"Enough,\" cried he, \"I yield. I bow before your gigantic power, which utterly surpasses that of the police. Give me your orders.\"  Before this Mascarin had conquered Hortebise and Paul Violaine, and now he had the Marquis at his feet. Many times during this conversation the Marquis had more than once endeavored to make up his mind to withdraw entirely from the business, but he had been unable to resist the strange fascination of that mysterious person who had been laying bare his scheme with such extraordinary audacity. The few vestiges of honesty that were still left in his corrupted soul revolted at the thought of the shameful compact into which he was about to enter, but the dazzling prospect held out before his eyes silenced his scruples, and he felt a certain pride in being the associate of men who possessed such seemingly illimitable power. Mascarin saw that there was no longer any necessity for the extreme firmness with which he had before spoken, and it was with the most studied courtesy that he replied: \"I have no orders to give you, Marquis, our interests are identical, and we must all have a voice in the deliberations as to the best means of carrying them out.\"  This change from _hauteur_ to suavity gratified Croisenois' pride immensely.  \"Now,\" continued Mascarin, \"let us speak of your own circumstances. You wrote to me recently that you had nothing, and I am aware that you have no expectations for the future.\"  \"Excuse me, but there is the fortune of my poor brother George, who disappeared so mysteriously.\"  \"Let me assure you,\" answered Mascarin, \"that we had better be perfectly frank with each other.\"  \"And am I not so?\" answered the Marquis.  \"Why, in talking of this imaginary fortune?\"  \"It is not imaginary; it is real, and a very large one, too, about twelve or fourteen hundred thousand francs, and I can obtain it, for, by Articles 127 and 129 of the Code Napoleon---\"  He interrupted himself, as he saw an expression of hardly-restrained laughter upon the features of Dr. Hortebise.  \"Do not talk nonsense,\" answered Mascarin. \"You could at first have filed an affidavit regarding your brother's disappearance, and applied to the Court to appoint you trustee, but this is now exactly what you wish to avoid.\"  \"Why not, pray? Do you think----\"  \"Pooh, pooh, but you have raised so much money on this inheritance that there is nothing of it left hardly, certainly not sufficient to pay your debts. It is the bait you used to allure your tradespeople into giving you credit.\"  At finding himself so easily fathomed, Croisenois burst into a peel of laughter. Mascarin had by this time thrown himself into an armchair, as though utterly worn out by fatigue.  \"There is no necessity, Marquis,\" said he, \"to detain you here longer. We shall meet again shortly, and settle matters. Meanwhile Catenac will draw up the prospectus and Articles of Association of the proposed Company, and post you up in the financial slang of which you must occasionally make use.\"  The Marquis and the lawyer at once rose and took their leave. As soon as the door had closed behind them, Mascarin seemed to recover his energy.  \"Well, Paul,\" said he, \"what do you think of all this?\"  Like all men with weak and ductile natures, Paul, after being almost prostrated by the first discovery of his master's villainy, had now succeeded in smothering the dictates of his conscience, and adopted a cynical tone quite worthy of his companions.  \"I see,\" said he, \"that you have need of me. Well, I am not a Marquis, but you will find me quite as trustworthy and obedient.\"  Paul's reply did not seem to surprise Mascarin, but it is doubtful whether he was pleased by it, for his countenance showed traces of a struggle between extreme satisfaction and intense annoyance, while the doctor was surprised at the cool audacity of the young man whose mind he had undertaken to form.  Paul was a little disturbed by the long and continued silence of his patron, and at last he ventured to say timidly,--  \"Well, sir, I am anxious to know under what conditions I am to be shown the way to make my fortune and marry Mademoiselle Flavia Rigal, whom I love.\"  Mascarin gave a diabolical smile.  \"Whose dowry you love,\" he observed. \"Let us speak plainly.\"  \"Pardon me, sir, I said just what I meant.\"  The doctor, who had not Mascarin's reasons for gravity, now burst into a jovial laugh.  \"And that pretty Rose,\" said he, \"what of her?\"  \"Rose is a creature of the past,\" answered Paul. \"I can now see what an idiot I was, and I have entirely effaced her from my memory, and I am half inclined to deplore that Mademoiselle Rigal is an heiress, the more so if it is to form a barrier between us.\"  This declaration seemed to make Mascarin more easy.  \"Reassure yourself, my boy,\" said he, \"we will remove that barrier; but I will not conceal from you that the part you have to play is much more difficult than that assigned to the Marquis de Croisenois; but if it is harder and more perilous, the reward will be proportionately greater.\"  \"With your aid and advice I feel capable of doing everything necessary,\" returned Paul.  \"You will need great self-confidence, the utmost self-possession, and as a commencement you must utterly destroy your present identity.\"  \"That I will do with the utmost willingness.\"  \"You must become another person entirely; you must adopt his name, his gait, his behavior, his virtues, and even his failings. You must forget all that you have either said or done. You must always think that you are in reality the person you represent yourself to be, for this is the only way in which you can lead others into a similar belief. Your task will be a heavy one.\"  \"Ah, sir,\" cried the young man, enthusiastically, \"can you doubt me?\"  \"The glorious beam of success that shines ahead of you will take your attention from the difficulties and dangers of the road that you are treading.\"  The genial Dr. Hortebise rubbed his hands.  \"You are right,\" cried he, \"quite right.\"  \"When you have done this,\" resumed Mascarin, \"we shall not hesitate to acquaint you with the secret of the lofty destiny that awaits you. Do you understand me fully?\"  Here the speaker was interrupted by the entrance of Beaumarchef, who had signified his desire to come in by three distinct raps upon the door. He was now gorgeous to look upon, for having taken advantage of a spare half hour, he had donned his best clothes.  \"What is it?\" demanded Mascarin.  \"Here are two letters, sir.\"  \"Thank you; hand them to me, and leave us.\"  As soon as they were once more alone, Mascarin examined the letters.  \"Ah,\" cried he, \"one from Van Klopen, and the other from the Hotel de Mussidan. Let us first see what our friend the man-milliner has to say.  \"DEAR SIR,--  \"You may be at ease. Our mutual friend Verminet has executed your orders most adroitly. At his instigation Gaston de Gandelu has forged the banker Martin Rigal's signature on five different bills. I hold them, and awaiting your further orders regarding them, and also with respect to Madame de Bois Arden,  \"I remain your obedient servant,  \"VAN KLOPEN.\"   Tossing it on the table, Mascarin opened the other letter, which he also read aloud.  \"SIR,--  \"I have to report to you the breaking off of the marriage between Mademoiselle Sabine and M. de Breulh-Faverlay. Mademoiselle is very ill, and I heard the medical man say that she might not survive the next twenty-four hours.  \"FLORESTAN.\"   Mascarin was so filled with rage on learning this piece of news, which seemed likely to interfere with his plans, that he struck his hand down heavily on the table.  \"Damnation!\" cried he. \"If this little fool should die now, all our work will have to be recommenced.\"  He thrust aside his chair, and paced hurriedly up and down the room.  \"Florestan is right,\" said he; \"this illness of the girl comes on at the date of the rupture of the engagement. There is some secret that we must learn, for we dare not work in the dark.\"  \"Shall I go to the Hotel de Mussidan?\" asked Hortebise.  \"Not a bad idea. Your carriage is waiting, is it not? You can go in your capacity as a medical man.\"  The doctor was preparing to go, when Mascarin arrested his progress.  \"No,\" said he, \"I have changed my mind. We must neither of us be seen near the place. I expect that one of our mines has exploded; that the Count and Countess have exchanged confidences, and that between the two the daughter has been struck down.\"  \"How shall we find this out?\"  \"I will see Florestan and try and find out.\"  In an instant he vanished into his inner room, and as he changed his dress, continued to converse with the doctor.  \"This blow would be comparatively trifling, if I had not so much on hand, but I have Paul to look after. The Champdoce affair must be pressed on, for Catenac, the traitor, has put the Duke and Perpignan into communication. I must see Perpignan and discover how much has been told him, and how much he has guessed. I will also see Caroline Schimmel, and extract something from her. I wish to heaven that there were thirty-six hours in the day instead of only twenty-four.\"  By this time he had completed his change of costume and called the doctor into his room.  \"I am off, now,\" whispered he; \"do not lose sight of Paul for a single instant, for we are not sufficiently sure of him to let him go about alone with our secret in his possession. Take him to dine at Martin Rigal's, and then make some excuse for keeping him all night at your rooms. See me to-morrow.\"  And he went out so hurriedly that he did not hear the cheery voice of the doctor calling after him,--  \"Good luck; I wish you all good luck.\"    CHAPTER XIX.  A FRIENDLY RIVAL.  On leaving the Hotel de Mussidan, M. de Breulh-Faverlay dismissed his carriage, for he felt as a man often does after experiencing some violent emotion, the absolute necessity for exercise, and to be alone with his thoughts, and by so doing recover his self-possession. His friends would have been surprised if they had seen him pacing hurriedly along the Champs Elysees. The usual calm of his manner had vanished, and the generally calm expression of his features was entirely absent. As he walked, he talked to himself, and gesticulated.  \"And this is what we call being a man of the world. We think ourselves true philosophers, and a look from a pair of beautiful, pleading eyes scatters all our theories to the winds.\"  He had loved Sabine upon the day on which he had asked for her hand, but not so fondly as upon this day when he had learned that she could no longer be his wife, for, from the moment he had made this discovery, she seemed to him more gifted and fascinating than ever. No one could have believed that he, the idol of society, the petted darling of the women, and the successful rival of the men, could have been refused by the young girl to whom he had offered his hand.  \"Yes,\" murmured he with a sigh, \"for she is just the companion for life that I longed for. Where could I find so intelligent an intellect and so pure a mind, united with such radiant beauty, so different from the women of society, who live but for dress and gossip. Has Sabine anything in common with those giddy girls who look upon life as a perpetual value, and who take a husband as they do a partner, because they cannot dance without one? How her face lighted up as she spoke of him, and how thoroughly she puts faith in him! The end of it all is that I shall die a bachelor. In my old age I will take to the pleasures of the table, for an excellent authority declares that a man can enjoy his four meals a day with comfort. Well, that is something to look forward to certainly, and it will not impair my digestion if my heirs and expectants come and squabble round my armchair. Ah,\" he added, with a deep sigh, \"my life has been a failure.\"  M. de Breulh-Faverlay was a very different type of man to that which both his friends and his enemies popularly supposed him to be. Upon the death of his uncle, he had plunged into the frivolous vortex of Parisian dissipation, but of this he had soon wearied.  All that he had cared for was to see the doings of his racehorse chronicled in the sporting journals, and occasionally to expend a few thousand francs in presents of jewelry to some fashionable actress. But he had secretly longed for some more honorable manner of fulfilling his duties in life, and he had determined that before his marriage he would sell his stud and break with his old associates entirely; and now this wished-for marriage would never take place.  When he entered his club, the traces of his agitation were so visible upon his face, that some of the card-players stopped their game to inquire if Chambertin, the favorite for the Chantilly cup, had broken down.  \"No, no,\" replied he, as he hurriedly made his way to the writing-room, \"Chambertin is as sound as a bell.\"  \"What the deuce has happened to De Breulh?\" asked one of the members.  \"Goodness gracious!\" remarked the man to whom the question was addressed, \"he seems in a hurry to write a letter.\"  The gentleman was right. M. de Breulh was writing a withdrawal from his demand for Sabine's hand to M. de Mussidan, and he found the task by no means an easy one, for on reading it over he found that there was a valid strain of bitterness throughout it, which would surely attract attention and perhaps cause embarrassing questions to be put to him.  \"No,\" murmured he, \"this letter is quite unworthy of me.\" And tearing it up, he began another, in which he strung together several conventional excuses, alleging the difficulty of breaking off his former habits and of an awkward entanglement which he had been unable to break with, as he had anticipated. When this little masterpiece of diplomacy was completed, he rang the bell, and, handing it to one of the club servants, told him to take it to the Count de Mussidan's house. When this unpleasant duty was over, M. de Breulh had hoped to experience some feeling of relief, but in this he was mistaken. He tried cards, but rose from the table in a quarter of an hour; he ordered dinner, but appetite was wanting; he went to the opera, but then he did nothing but yawn, and the music grated on his nerves. At length he returned home. The day had seemed interminable, and he could not sleep, for Sabine's face was ever before him. Who could this man be whom she so fondly loved and preferred before all others? He respected her too much not to feel assured that her choice was a worthy one, but his experience had taught him that when so many men of the world fell into strange entanglements, a poor girl without knowledge of the dangers around her might easily be entrapped. \"If he is worthy of her,\" thought he, \"I will do my best to aid her; but if not, I will open her eyes.\"  At four o'clock in the morning he was still seated musing before the expiring embers of his fire; he had made up his mind to see Andre--there was no difficulty in this, for a man of taste and wealth can find a ready excuse for visiting the studio of a struggling artist. He had no fixed plan as to what he would say or do, he left all to chance, and with this decision he went to bed, and by two in the afternoon he drove straight to the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne.  Andre's discreet portress was as usual leaning on her broom in the gallery as M. de Breulh's magnificent equipage drew up.  \"Gracious me!\" exclaimed the worthy woman, dazzled by the gorgeousness of the whole turnout; \"he can't be coming here, he must have mistaken the house.\"  But her amazement reached its height when M. de Breulh, on alighting, asked for Andre.  \"Fourth story, first door to the right,\" answered the woman; \"but I will show you the way.\"  \"Don't trouble yourself;\" and with these words M. de Breulh ascended the staircase that led to the painter's studio and knocked on the door. As he did so, he heard a quick, light step upon the stairs, and a young and very dark man, dressed in a weaver's blouse and carrying a tin pail which he had evidently just filled with water from the cistern, came up.  \"Are you M. Andre?\" asked De Breulh.  \"That is my name, sir.\"  \"I wish to say a few words to you.\"  \"Pray come in,\" replied the young artist, opening the door of his studio and ushering his visitor in. Andre's voice and expression had made a favorable impression upon his visitor; but he was, in spite of his having thrown aside nearly all foolish prejudices, a little startled at his costume. He did not, however, allow his surprise to be visible.  \"I ought to apologize for receiving you like this,\" remarked Andre quickly, \"but a poor man must wait upon himself.\" As he spoke, he threw off his blouse and set down the pail in a corner of the room.  \"I rather should offer my excuse for my intrusion,\" returned M. de Breulh. \"I came here by the advice of one of my friends;\" he stopped for an instant, endeavoring to think of a name.  \"By Prince Crescensi, perhaps,\" suggested Andre.  \"Yes, yes,\" continued M. de Breulh, eagerly snatching at the rope the artist held out to him. \"The Prince sings your praises everywhere, and speaks of your talents with the utmost enthusiasm. I am, on his recommendation, desirous of commissioning you to paint a picture for me, and I can assure you that in my gallery it will have no need to be ashamed of its companions.\"  Andre bowed, coloring deeply at the compliment.  \"I am obliged to you,\" said he, \"and I trust that you will not be disappointed in taking the Prince's opinion of my talent.\"  \"Why should I be so?\"  \"Because, for the last four months I have been so busy that I have really nothing to show you.\"  \"That is of no importance. I have every confidence in you.\"  \"Then,\" returned Andre, \"all that we have to do is to choose a subject.\"  Andre's manner had by this time so captivated De Breulh that he muttered to himself, \"I really ought to hate this fellow, but on my word I like him better than any one I have met for a long time.\"  Andre had by this time placed a large portfolio on the table. \"Here,\" said he, \"are some twenty or thirty sketches; if any of them took your fancy, you could make your choice.\"  \"Let me see them,\" returned De Breulh politely, for having made an estimate of the young man's character, he now wished to see what his artistic talents were like. With this object in view he examined all the sketches in the portfolio minutely, and then turned to those on the walls. Andre said nothing, but he somehow felt that this visit would prove the turning-point of his misfortunes. But for all that the young man's heart was very sad, for it was two days since Sabine had left him, promising to write to him the next morning regarding M. de Breulh-Faverlay, but as yet he had received no communication, and he was on the tenterhooks of expectation, not because he had any doubt of Sabine, but for the reason that he had no means of obtaining any information of what went on in the interior of the Hotel de Mussidan. M. de Breulh had now finished his survey, and had come to the conclusion that though many of Andre's productions were crude and lacking in finish, yet that he had the true artistic metal in him. He extended his hand to the young man and said forcibly, \"I am no longer influenced by the opinion of a friend. I have seen and judged for myself, and am more desirous than ever of possessing one of your pictures. I have made my choice of a subject, and now let us discuss the details.\"  As he spoke he handed a little sketch to Andre. It was a view of everyday life, which the painter had entitled, \"Outside the Barrier.\" Two men with torn garments and wine-flushed faces were struggling in tipsy combat, while on the right hand side of the picture lay a woman, bleeding profusely from a cut on the forehead, and two of her terrified companions were bending over her, endeavoring to restore her to consciousness. In the background were some flying figures, who were hastening up to separate the combatants. The sketch was one of real life, denuded of any sham element of romance, and this was the one that M. de Breulh had chosen. The two men discussed the size of the picture, and not a single detail was omitted.  \"I am sure that you will do all that is right,\" remarked De Breulh. \"Let your own inspiration guide you, and all will be well.\" In reality he was dying to get away, for he felt in what a false position he was, and with a violent effort he approached the money part of the matter.  \"Monsieur,\" said Andre, \"it is impossible to fix a price; when completed, a picture may only be worth the canvas that it is painted on, or else beyond all price. Let us wait.\"  \"Well,\" broke in M. de Breulh, \"what do you say to ten thousand francs?\"  \"Too much,\" returned Andre with a deprecatory wave of his hand; \"far too much. If I succeed in it, as I hope to do, I will ask six thousand francs for it.\"  \"Agreed!\" answered De Breulh, taking from his pocket an elegant note-case with his crest and monogram upon it and extracting from it three thousand francs. \"I will, as is usual, deposit half the price in advance.\"  Andre blushed scarlet. \"You are joking,\" said he.  \"Not at all,\" answered De Breulh quietly; \"I have my own way of doing business, from which I never deviate.\"  In spite of this answer Andre's pride was hurt.  \"But,\" remarked he, \"this picture will not be ready for perhaps six or seven months. I have entered into a contract with a wealthy builder, named Candele, to execute the outside decorations of his house.\"  \"Never mind that,\" answered M. de Breulh; \"take as long as you like.\"  Of course, after this, Andre could offer no further opposition; he therefore took the money without another word.  \"And now,\" said De Breulh, as he paused for a moment at the open doorway, \"let me wish you my good luck, and if you will come and breakfast with me one day, I think I can show you some pictures which you will really appreciate.\" And handing his card to the artist, he went downstairs.  At first Andre did not glance at the card, but when he did so, the letters seemed to sear his eyeballs like a red-hot iron. For a moment he could hardly breathe, and then a feeling of intense anger took possession of him, for he felt that he had been trifled with and deceived.  Hardly knowing what he was doing, he rushed out on the landing, and, leaning over the banister, called out loudly, \"Sir, stop a moment!\"  De Breulh, who had by this time reached the bottom of the staircase, turned round.  \"Come back, if you please,\" said Andre.  After a moment's hesitation, De Breulh obeyed; and when he was again in the studio, Andre addressed him in a voice that quivered with indignation.  \"Take back these notes, sir; I will not accept them.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Only that I have thought the matter over, and that I will not accept your commission.\"  \"And why this sudden change?\"  \"You know perfectly well, M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"  The gentleman at once saw that Sabine had mentioned his name to the young artist, and with a slight lacking of generous feeling said,--  \"Let me hear your reasons, sir.\"  \"Because, because----\" stammered the young man.  \"Because is not an answer.\"  Andre's confusion became greater. He would not tell the whole truth, for he would have died sooner than bring Sabine's name into the discussion; and he could only see one way out of his difficulty.  \"Suppose I say that I do not like your manner or appearance,\" returned he disdainfully.  \"Is it your wish to insult me, M. Andre?\"  \"As you choose to take it.\"  M. de Breulh was not gifted with an immense stock of patience. He turned livid, and made a step forward; but his generous impulses restrained him, and it was in a voice broken by agitation that he said,--  \"Accept my apologies, M. Andre; I fear that I have played a part unworthy of you and of myself. I ought to have given you my name at once. I know everything.\"  \"I do not comprehend you,\" answered Andre in a glacial voice.  \"Why doubt, then, if you do not understand? However, I have given you cause to do so. But, let me reassure you, Mademoiselle Sabine has spoken to me with the utmost frankness; and, if you still distrust me, let me tell you that this veiled picture is her portrait. I will say more,\" continued De Breulh gravely, as the artist still kept silent; \"yesterday, at Mademoiselle de Mussidan's request, I withdrew from my position as a suitor for her hand.\"  Andre had already been touched by De Breulh's frank and open manner, and these last words entirely conquered him.  \"I can never thank you enough,\" began he.  But De Breulh interrupted him.  \"A man should not be thanked for performing his duty. I should lie to you if I said that I am not painfully surprised at her communication; but tell me, had you been in my place, would you not have acted in the same manner?\"  \"I think that I should.\"  \"And now we are friends, are we not?\" and again De Breulh held out his hand, which Andre clasped with enthusiasm.  \"Yes, yes,\" faltered he.  \"And now,\" continued De Breulh, with a forced smile, \"let us say no more about the picture, which was, after all, merely a pretext. As I came here I said to myself, 'If the man to whom Mademoiselle de Mussidan has given her heart is worthy of her, I will do all I can to advance his suit with her family!' I came here to see what you were like; and now I say to you, do me a great honor, and permit me to place myself, my fortune, and the influence of my friends, at your disposal.\"  The offer was made in perfect good faith, but Andre shook his head.  \"I shall never forget your kindness in making this offer, but----\"; he paused for a moment, and then went on: \"I will be as open as you have been, and will tell you the whole truth. You may think me foolish; but remember, though I am poor, I have still my self-respect to maintain. I love Sabine, and would give my life for her. Do not be offended at what I am about to say. I would, however, sooner give up her hand than be indebted for it to you.\"  \"But this is mere madness.\"  \"No, sir, it is the purest wisdom; for were I to accede to your wishes, I should feel deeply humiliated by the thought of your self-denial; for I should be madly jealous of the part you were playing. You are of high birth and princely fortune, while I am utterly friendless and unknown; all that I am deficient in you possess.\"  \"But I have been poor myself,\" interposed De Breulh, \"and perhaps endured even greater miseries than ever you have done. Do you know what I was doing at your age? I was slowly starving to death at Sonora, and had to take the humblest position in a cattle ranch. Do you think that those days taught me nothing?\"  \"You will be able to judge me all the more clearly then,\" returned Andre. \"If I raise myself up to Sabine's level, as she begged me to, then I shall feel that I am your equal; but if I accept your aid, I am your dependent; and I will obey her wishes or perish in the effort.\"  Up to this moment the passion which stirred Andre's inmost soul had breathed in every word he uttered; but, checking himself by a mighty effort, he resumed in a tone of greater calmness,--  \"But I ought to remember how much we already owe you, and I hope that you will allow me to call myself your friend?\"  M. de Breulh's noble nature enabled him to understand Andre's scruples; his feelings, however, would not for the instant enable him to speak. He slowly put the notes back in their receptacle, and then said in a low voice,--  \"Your conduct is that of an honorable man; and remember this, at all times and seasons you may rely upon De Breulh-Faverlay. Farewell!\"  As soon as he was alone, Andre threw himself into an armchair, and mused over this unexpected interview, which had proved a source of such solace to his feelings. All that he now longed for was a letter from Sabine. At this moment the portress entered with a letter. Andre was so occupied with his thoughts that he hardly noticed this act of condescension on the part of the worthy woman.  \"A letter!\" exclaimed he; and, tearing it open, he glanced at the signature. But Sabine's name was not there; it was signed Modeste. What could Sabine's maid have to say to him? He felt that some great misfortune was impending, and, trembling with excitement, he read the letter.  \"SIR,--  \"I write to tell you that my mistress has succeeded in the matter she spoke of to you; but I am sorry to say that I have bad news to give you, for she is seriously ill.\"  \"Ill!\" exclaimed Andre, crushing up the letter in his hands, and dashing it upon the floor. \"Ill! ill!\" he repeated, not heeding the presence of the portress; \"why, she may be dead;\" and, snatching up his hat, he dashed downstairs into the street.  As soon as the portress was left alone, she picked up the letter, smoothed it out, and read it.  \"And so,\" murmured she, \"the little lady's name was Sabine--a pretty name; and she is ill, is she? I expect that the old gent who called this morning, and asked so many questions about M. Andre, would give a good deal for this note; but no, that would not be fair.\"    CHAPTER XX.  A COUNCIL OF WAR.  Mad with his terrible forebodings, Andre hurried through the streets in the direction of the Hotel de Mussidan, caring little for the attention that his excited looks and gestures caused. He had no fixed plan as to what to do when he arrived there, and it was only on reaching the Rue de Matignon that he recovered sufficient coolness to deliberate and reflect.  He had arrived at the desired spot; how should he set to work to obtain the information that he required? The evening was a dark one, and the gas-lamps showed a feeble light through the dull February fog. There were no signs of life in the Rue de Matignon, and the silence was only broken by the continuous surge of carriage wheels in the Faubourg Saint Honore. This gloom, and the inclemency of the weather, added to the young painter's depression. He saw his utter helplessness, and felt that he could not move a step without compromising the woman he so madly adored. He walked to the gate of the house, hoping to gain some information even from the exterior aspect of the house; for it seemed to him that if Sabine were dying, the very stones in the street would utter sounds of woe and lamentation; but the fog had closely enwrapped the house, and he could hardly see which of the windows were lighted. His reasoning faculties told him that there was no use in waiting, but an inner voice warned him to stay. Would Modeste, who had written to him, divine, by some means that he was there, in an agony of suspense, and come out to give him information and solace? All at once a thought darted across his mind, vivid as a flash of lightning.  \"M. de Breulh will help me,\" cried he; \"for though I cannot go to the house, he will have no difficulty in doing so.\"  By good luck, he had M. de Breulh's card in his pocket, and hurried off to his address. M. de Breulh had a fine house in the Avenue de l'Imperatrice, which he had taken more for the commodiousness of the stables than for his own convenience.  \"I wish to see M. de Breulh,\" said Andre, as he stopped breathless at the door, where a couple of footmen were chatting.  The men looked at him with supreme contempt. \"He is out,\" one of them at last condescended to reply.  Andre had by this time recovered his coolness, and taking out De Breulh's card, wrote these words on it in pencil: \"One moment's interview. ANDRE.\"  \"Give this to your master as soon as he comes in,\" said he.  Then he descended the steps slowly. He was certain that M. de Breulh was in the house, and that he would send out after the person who had left the card almost at once. His conclusion proved right; in five minutes he was overtaken by the panting lackey, who, conducting him back to the house, showed him into a magnificently furnished library. De Breulh feared that some terrible event had taken place.  \"What has happened?\" said he.  \"Sabine is dying;\" and Andre at once proceeded to inform De Breulh of what had happened since his departure.  \"But how can I help you?\"  \"You can go and make inquiries at the house.\"  \"Reflect; yesterday I wrote to the Count, and broke off a marriage, the preliminaries of which had been completely settled; and within twenty-four hours to send and inquire after his daughter's health would be to be guilty of an act of inexcusable insolence; for it would look as if I fancied that Mademoiselle de Mussidan had been struck down by my rupture of the engagement.\"  \"You are right,\" murmured Andre dejectedly.  \"But,\" continued De Breulh, after a moment's reflection, \"I have a distant relative, a lady who is also a connection of the Mussidan family, the Viscountess de Bois Arden, and she will be glad to be of service to me. She is young and giddy, but as true as steel. Come with me to her; my carriage is ready.\"  The footmen were surprised at seeing their master on such terms of intimacy with the shabbily dressed young man, but ventured, of course, on no remarks.  Not a word was exchanged during the brief drive to Madame de Bois Arden's house.  \"Wait for me,\" exclaimed De Breulh, springing from the vehicle as soon as it drew up; \"I will be back directly.\"  Madame de Bois Arden is justly called one of the handsomest women in Paris. Very fair, with masses of black hair, and a complexion to which art has united itself to the gifts of nature, she is a woman who has been everywhere, knows everything, talks incessantly, and generally very well. She spends forty thousand francs per annum on dress. She is always committing all sorts of imprudent acts, and scandal is ever busy with her name. Half a dozen of the opposite sex have been talked of in connection with her, while in reality she is a true and faithful wife, for, in spite of all her frivolity, she adores her husband, and is in great awe of him. Such was the character of the lady into whose apartment M. de Breulh was introduced. Madame de Bois Arden was engaged in admiring a very pretty fancy costume of the reign of Louis XV., one of Van Klopen's masterpieces, when M. de Breulh was announced, which she was going to wear, on her return from the opera, at a masquerade ball at the Austrian Ambassador's. Madame de Bois Arden greeted her visitor with effusion, for they had been acquaintances from childhood, and always addressed each other by their Christian names.  \"What, you here at this hour, Gontran!\" said the lady. \"Is it a vision, or only a miracle?\" But the smile died away upon her lips, as she caught a glimpse of her visitor's pale and harassed face. \"Is there anything the matter?\" asked she.  \"Not yet,\" answered he, \"but there may be, for I hear that Mademoiselle de Mussidan is dangerously ill.\"  \"Is she really? Poor Sabine! what is the matter with her?\"  \"I do not know; and I want you, Clotilde, to send one of your people to inquire into the truth of what we have heard.\"  Madame de Bois Arden opened her eyes very wide.  \"Are you joking?\" said she. \"Why do you not send yourself?\"  \"It is impossible for me to do so; and if you have any kindness of heart, you do as I ask you; and I want you also to promise me not to say a word of this to any one.\"  Excited as she was by this mystery, Madame de Bois Arden did not ask another question.  \"I will do exactly what you want,\" replied she, \"and respect your secret. I would go at once, were it not that Bois Arden will never sit down to dinner without me; but the moment we have finished I will go.\"  \"Thanks, a thousand times; and now I will go home and wait for news from you.\"  \"Not at all,--you will remain here to dinner.\"  \"I must,--I have a friend waiting for me.\"  \"Do as you please, then,\" returned the Viscountess, laughing. \"I will send round a note this evening.\"  De Breulh pressed her hand, and hurried down, and was met by Andre at the door, for he had been unable to sit still in the carriage.  \"Keep up your courage. Madame de Bois Arden had not heard of Mademoiselle Sabine's illness, and this looks as if it was not a very serious matter. We shall have the real facts in three hours.\"  \"Three hours!\" groaned Andre, \"what a lapse of time!\"  \"It is rather long, I admit; but we will talk of her while we wait, for you must stay and dine with me.\"  Andre yielded, for he had no longer the energy to contest anything. The dinner was exquisite, but the two men were not in a condition of mind to enjoy it, and scarcely consumed anything. Vainly did they endeavor to speak on indifferent subjects, and when the coffee had been served in the library, they relapsed into utter silence. As the clock struck ten, however, a knock was heard at the door, then whisperings, and the rustle of female attire, and lastly Madame de Bois Arden burst upon them like a tornado.  \"Here I am,\" cried she.  It was certainly rather a hazardous step to pay such a late visit to a bachelor's house, but then the Viscountess de Bois Arden did exactly as she pleased.  \"I have come here, Gontran,\" exclaimed she, with extreme vehemence, \"to tell you that I think your conduct is abominable and ungentlemanly.\"  \"Clotilde!\"  \"Hold your tongue! you are a wretch! Ah! now I can see why you did not wish to write and inquire about poor Sabine. You well knew the effect that your message would have on her.\"  M. de Breulh smiled as he turned to Andre and said,--  \"You see that I was right in what I told you.\"  This remark for the first time attracted Madame de Bois Arden's attention to the fact that a stranger was present, and she trembled lest she had committed some grave indiscretion.  \"Gracious heavens!\" exclaimed she, with a start, \"why, I thought that we were alone!\"  \"This gentleman has all my confidence,\" replied M. de Breulh seriously; and as he spoke he laid his hand upon Andre's shoulder. \"Permit me to introduce M. Andre to you, my dear Clotilde; he may not be known to-day, but in a short time his reputation will be European.\"  Andre bowed, but for once in her life the Viscountess felt embarrassed, for she was surprised at the extremely shabby attire of this confidential friend, and then there seemed something wanting to the name.  \"Then,\" resumed De Breulh, \"Mademoiselle de Mussidan is really ill, and our information is correct.\"  \"She is.\"  \"Did you see her?\"  \"I did, Gontran; and had you seen her, your heart would have been filled with pity, and you would have repented your conduct toward her. The poor girl did not even know me. She lay in her bed, whiter than the very sheets, cold and inanimate as a figure of marble. Her large black eyes were staring wildly, and the only sign of life she exhibited was when the great tears coursed down her cheeks.\"  Andre had determined to restrain every token of emotion in the presence of the Viscountess, but her recital was too much for him.  \"Ah!\" said he, \"she will die; I know it.\"  There was such intense anguish in his tone that even the practised woman of the world was softened.  \"I assure you, sir,\" said she, \"that you go too far; there is no present danger; the doctors say it is catalepsy, which often attacks persons of a nervous temperament upon the receipt of a sudden mental shock.\"  \"But what shock has she received?\" asked Andre.  \"No one told me,\" answered she after a short pause, \"that Sabine's illness was caused by the breaking off of her engagement; but, of course, I supposed that it was.\"  \"That was not the reason, Clotilde; but you have told us nothing; pray, go on,\" interposed De Breulh.  The extreme calmness of her cousin, and a glance which she observed passing between him and Andre, enlightened the Viscountess somewhat.  \"I asked as much as I dared,\" she replied, \"but I could only get the vaguest answers. Sabine looked as if she were dead, and her father and mother hovered around her couch like two spectres. Had they slain her with their own hands, they could not have looked more guilty; their faces frightened me.\"  \"Tell me precisely what answers were given to your questions,\" broke in he impatiently.  \"Sabine had seemed so agitated all day, that her mother asked her if she was suffering any pain.\"  \"We know that already.\"  \"Indeed!\" replied the Viscountess, with a look of surprise. \"It seems, cousin, that you saw Sabine that afternoon, but what became of her afterward no one appears to know; but there is positive proof that she did not leave the house, and received no letters. At all events, it was more than an hour after her maid saw her enter her own room. Sabine said a few unintelligible words to the girl, who, seeing the pallor upon her mistress's face, ran up to her. Just as she did so, Sabine uttered a wild shriek, and fell to the ground. She was raised up and laid upon the bed, but since then she has neither moved nor spoken.\"  \"That is not all,\" said De Breulh, who had watched his cousin keenly.  The Viscountess started, and avoided meeting her cousin's eye.  \"I do not understand,\" she faltered. \"Why do you look at me like that?\"  De Breulh, who had been pacing up and down the room, suddenly halted in front of the Viscountess.  \"My dear Clotilde,\" said he, \"I am sure when I tell you that the tongue of scandal has often been busy with your name, I am telling you nothing new.\"  \"Pooh!\" answered the Viscountess. \"What do I care for that?\"  \"But I always defended you. You are indiscreet--your presence here tonight shows this; but you are, after all, a true woman,--brave and true as steel.\"  \"What do you mean by this exordium, Gontran?\"  \"This, Clotilde,--I want to know if I dare venture to intrust to you a secret which involves the honor of two persons, and, perhaps, the lives of more.\"  \"Thank you, Gontran,\" answered she calmly. \"You have formed a correct judgment of me.\"  But here Andre felt that he must interpose, and, taking a step forward, said, \"Have you the right to speak?\"  \"My dear Andre,\" said De Breulh, \"this is a matter in which my honor is as much concerned as yours. Will you not trust me?\" Then turning to the Viscountess, he added, \"Tell us all you heard.\"  \"It is only something I heard from Modeste. You had hardly left the house, when the Baron de Clinchain made his appearance.\"  \"An eccentric old fellow, a friend of the Count de Mussidan's. I know him.\"  \"Just so; well, they had a stormy interview, and at the end of it, the Baron was taken ill, and it was with difficulty that he regained his carriage.\"  \"That seems curious.\"  \"Wait a bit. After that Octave and his wife had a terrible scene together, and Modeste thinks that her mistress must have heard something, for the Count's voice rang through the house like thunder.\"  Every word that the Viscountess uttered strengthened De Breulh's suspicions. \"There is something mysterious in all this, Clotilde,\" said he, \"as you will say when you know the whole truth,\" and, without omitting a single detail, he related the whole of Sabine and Andre's love story.  Madame de Bois Arden listened attentively, sometimes thrilled with horror, and at others pleased with this tale of innocent love.  \"Forgive me,\" said she, when her cousin had concluded; \"my reproaches and accusations were equally unfounded.\"  \"Yes, yes; never mind that; but I am afraid that there is some hidden mystery which will place a fresh stumbling-block in our friend Andre's path.\"  \"Do not say that,\" cried Andre, in terror. \"What is it?\"  \"That I cannot tell; for Mademoiselle de Mussidan's sake, I have withdrawn all my pretensions to her hand,--not to leave the field open to any other intruder, but in order that she may be your wife.\"  \"How are we to learn what has really happened?\" asked the Viscountess.  \"In some way or other we shall find out, if you will be our ally.\"  Most women are pleased to busy themselves about a marriage, and the Viscountess was cheered to find herself mixed up in so romantic a drama.  \"I am entirely at your beck and call,\" answered she. \"Have you any plan?\"  \"Not yet, but I will soon. As far as Mademoiselle de Mussidan is concerned, we must act quite openly. Andre will write to her, asking for an explanation, and you shall see her to-morrow, and if she is well enough, give her his note.\"  The proposal was a startling one, and the Viscountess did not entertain it favorably.  \"No,\" said she, \"I think that would not do at all.\"  \"Why not? However, let us leave it to Andre.\"  Andre, thus addressed, stepped forward, and said,--  \"I do not think that it would be delicate to let Mademoiselle de Mussidan know that her secret is known to any one else than ourselves.\"  The Viscountess nodded assent.  \"If,\" continued Andre, \"the Viscountess will be good enough to ask Modeste to meet me at the corner of the Avenue de Matignon; I shall be there.\"  \"A capital idea, sir,\" said the lady, \"and I will give your message to Modeste.\" She broke off her speech suddenly, and uttered a pretty little shriek, as she noticed that the hands of the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to twenty to twelve. \"Great heavens!\" cried she, \"and I am going to a ball at the Austrian Embassy, and now not even dressed.\" And, with a coquettish gesture, she drew her shawl around her, and ran out of the room, exclaiming as she descended the stairs, \"I will call here to-morrow, Gontran, on my way to the Bois,\" and disappeared like lightning.  Andre and his host sat over the fire, and conversed for a long time. It seemed strange that two men who had met that morning for the first time should now be on such intimate terms of friendship; but such was the case, for a mutual feeling of admiration and respect had sprung up in their hearts.  M. de Breulh wished to send Andre home in his carriage, but this the young man declined, and merely borrowed an overcoat to protect him from the inclemency of the weather.  \"To-morrow,\" said he, as he made his way home, \"Modeste shall tell all she knows, provided always that that charming society dame does not forget all about our existence before then.\"  Madame de Bois Arden, however, could sometimes be really in earnest. Upon her return from the ball she would not even go to bed, lest she should oversleep herself, and the next day Andre found Modeste waiting at the appointed spot, and learnt, to his great grief, that Sabine had not yet regained consciousness.  The family doctor betrayed no uneasiness, but expressed a wish for a consultation with another medical man. Meanwhile, the girl promised to meet Andre morning and evening in the same place, and give him such scraps of information as she had been able to pick up. For two whole days Mademoiselle de Mussidan's condition remained unchanged, and Andre spent his whole time between his own studio, the Avenue de Matignon, and M. de Breulh's, where he frequently met Madame de Bois Arden.  But on the third day Modest informed him, with tears in her eyes, that though the cataleptic fit had passed away, Sabine was struggling with a severe attack of fever. Modeste and Andre were so interested in their conversation, that they did not perceive Florestan, who had gone out to post a letter to Mascarin.  \"Listen, Modeste,\" whispered Andre, \"you tell me that she is in danger,--very great danger.\"  \"The doctor said that the crisis would take place to-day; be here at five this evening.\"  Andre staggered like a madman to De Breulh's house; and so excited was he that his friend insisted upon his taking some repose, and would not, when five o'clock arrived, permit Andre to go to the appointment alone. As they turned the corner, they saw Modeste hurrying toward them.  \"She is saved, she is saved!\" said she, \"for she has fallen into a tranquil sleep, and the doctor says that she will recover.\"  Andre and De Breulh were transported by this news; but they did not know that they were watched by two men, Mascarin and Florestan, who did not let one of their movements escape them. Warned by a brief note from Florestan, Mascarin had driven swiftly to Father Canon's public-house, where he thought he was certain to find the domestic, but the man was not there, and Mascarin, unable to endure further suspense, sent for him to the Hotel de Mussidan. When the servant informed Mascarin that the crisis was safely passed, he drew a deep breath of relief; for he no longer feared that the frail structure that he had built up with such patient care for twenty long years would be shattered at a blow by the chill hand of death. He bent his brow, however, when he heard of Modeste's daily interviews with the young man whom Florestan termed \"Mademoiselle's lover.\"  \"Ah,\" muttered he, \"if I could only be present at one of those interviews!\"  \"And, as you say,\" returned Florestan, drawing out, as he spoke, a neat-looking watch, \"it is just the hour of their meeting; and as the place is always the same, you--\"  \"Come, then,\" broke in his patron. They went out accordingly, and reached the Champs Elysees by a circuitous route. The place was admirably suited to their purpose, for close by were several of those little wooden huts, occupied in summer by the vendors of cakes and playthings.  \"Let us get behind one of these,\" said Florestan. Night was drawing in, but objects could still be distinguished, and in about five minutes Florestan whispered, \"Look, there comes Modeste, and there is the lover, but he has a pal with him to-night. Why, what can she be telling him? He seems quite overcome.\"  Mascarin divined the truth at once, and found that it would be a difficult task to interfere with the love of a man who displayed so much intensity of feeling.  \"Then,\" remarked Mascarin, savagely, \"that great booby, staggering about on his friend's arm, is your young lady's lover?\"  \"Just so, sir.\"  \"Then we must find out who he is.\"  Florestan put on a crafty air, and replied in gentle accents.  \"The day before yesterday, as I was smoking my pipe outside, I saw this young bantam swaggering down the street--not but what he seemed rather crestfallen; but I knew the reason for that, and should look just as much in the dumps if my young woman was laid up. I thought, as I had nothing to do, I might as well see who he was and where he lived; so, sticking my hands in my pockets, after him I sloped. He walked such a long way, that I got precious sick of my job, but at last I ran him to earth in a house. I went straight up to the lodge, and showed the portress my tobacco pouch, and said, 'I picked up this; I think that the gentleman who has just gone in dropped it. Do you know him?' 'Of course I do,' said she. 'He is a painter; lives on the fourth floor; and his name is M. Andre.'\"  \"Was the house in the Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne?\" broke in Mascarin.  \"You are right, sir,\" returned the man, taken a little aback. \"It seems, sir, that you are better informed than I am.\"  Mascarin did not notice the man's surprise, but he was struck with the strange persistency with which this young man seemed to cross his plans, for he found that the acquaintance of Rose and the lover of Mademoiselle de Mussidan were one and the same person, and he had a presentiment that he would in some way prove a hindrance to his plans.  The astute Mascarin concentrated all his attention upon Andre.  The latter said something to Modeste, which caused that young woman to raise her hands to heaven, as though in alarm.  \"But who is the other?\" asked he,--\"the fellow that looks like an Englishman?\"  \"Do you not know?\" returned the lackey. \"Why, that is M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"  \"What, the man who was to marry Sabine?\"  \"Certainly.\"  Mascarin was not easily disconcerted, but this time a blasphemous oath burst from his lips.  \"Do you mean,\" said he, \"that De Breulh and this painter are friends?\"  \"That is more than I can tell. You seem to want to know a lot,\" answered Florestan, sulkily.  Modeste had now left the young men, who walked arm in arm in the direction of the Avenue de l'Imperatrice.  \"M. de Breulh takes his dismissal easily enough,\" observed Mascarin.  \"He was not dismissed; it was he that wrote and broke off the engagement.\"  This time Mascarin contrived to conceal the terrible blow that this information caused to him, and even made some jesting remark as he took leave of Florestan; but he was in truth completely staggered, for after thoroughly believing that the game was won, he saw that, though perhaps not lost, his victory was postponed for an indefinite period.  \"What!\" said he, as he clenched his hand firmly, \"shall the headstrong passion of this foolish boy mar my plans? Let him take care of himself; for if he walks in my path, he will find it a road that leads to his own destruction.\"    CHAPTER XXI.  AN ACADEMY OF MUSIC.  Dr. Hortebise had for some time back given up arguing with Mascarin as to the advice the latter gave him. He had been ordered not to let Paul out of his sight, and he obeyed this command literally. He had taken him to dine at M. Martin Rigal's, though the host himself was absent; from there he took Paul to his club, and finally wound up by forcing the young man to accept a bed at his house. They both slept late, and were sitting down to a luxurious breakfast, when the servant announced M. Tantaine, and that worthy man made his appearance with the same smile upon his face which Paul remembered so well in the Hotel de Perou. The sight of him threw the young man into a state of fury. \"At last we meet,\" cried he. \"I have an account to settle with you.\"  \"You have an account to settle with me?\" asked Daddy Tantaine with a puzzled smile.  \"Yes; was it not through you that I was accused of theft by that old hag, Madame Loupins?\"  Tantaine shrugged his shoulders.  \"Dear me,\" said he; \"I thought that M. Mascarin had explained everything, and that you were anxious to marry Mademoiselle Flavia, and that, above all, you were a young man of intelligence and tact.\"  Hortebise roared with laughter, and Paul, seeing his folly, blushed deeply and remained silent.  \"I regret having disturbed you, doctor,\" resumed Tantaine, \"but I had strict orders to see you.\"  \"Is there anything new then?\"  \"Yes; Mademoiselle de Mussidan is out of danger, and M. de Croisenois can commence proceedings at once.\"  The doctor drank off a glass of wine. \"To the speedy marriage of our dear friend the Marquis and Mademoiselle Sabine,\" said he gayly.  \"So be it,\" said Tantaine; \"I am also directed to beg M. Paul not to leave this house, but to send for his luggage and remain here.\"  Hortebise looked so much annoyed that Tantaine hastened to add: \"Only as a temporary measure, for I am on the lookout for rooms for him now.\"  Paul looked delighted at the idea of having a home of his own.  \"Good!\" exclaimed the doctor merrily. \"And now, my dear Tantaine, as you have executed all your commissions, you can stay and breakfast with us.\"  \"Thanks for the honor; but I am very busy with affairs of the Duke de Champdoce and must see Perpignan at once.\" As he spoke he rose, making a little sign which Paul did not catch, and Hortebise accompanied him to the door of the vestibule. \"Don't leave that lad alone,\" said Tantaine; \"I will see about him to-morrow; meanwhile prepare him a little.\"  \"I comprehend,\" answered Hortebise; \"my kind regards to that dear fellow, Perpignan.\"  This Perpignan was well known--some people said too well known--in Paris. His real name was Isidore Crocheteau, and he had started life as a cook in a Palais Royal restaurant. Unfortunately a breach of the Eighth Commandment had caused him to suffer incarceration for a period of three years, and on his release he bloomed out into a private inquiry agent. His chief customers were jealous husbands, but as surely as one of these placed an affair in his hands, he would go to the erring wife and obtain a handsome price from her for his silence.  Mascarin and Perpignan had met in an affair of this kind; and as they mutually feared each other, they had tacitly agreed not to cross each other's path in that great wilderness of crime--Paris. But while Perpignan knew nothing of Mascarin's schemes and operations, the former was very well acquainted with the ex-cook's doings. He knew, for instance, that the income from the Inquiry Office would not cover Perpignan's expenses, who dressed extravagantly, kept a carriage, affected artistic tastes, played cards, betted on races, and liked good dinners at the most expensive restaurants. \"Where can he get his money from?\" asked Mascarin of himself; and, after a long search, he succeeded in solving the riddle.  Daddy Tantaine, after leaving the doctor's, soon arrived at the residence of M. Perpignan, and rang the bell.  A fat woman answered the door. \"M. Perpignan is out,\" said she.  \"When will he be back?\"  \"Some time this evening.\"  \"Can you tell me where I can find him, as it is of the utmost importance to both of us that I should see him at once?\"  \"He did not say where he was going to.\"  \"Perhaps he is at the factory,\" said Tantaine blandly.  The fat woman was utterly taken aback by this suggestion. \"What do you know about that?\" faltered she.  \"You see I _do_ know, and that is sufficient for you. Come, is he there?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"Thank you, I will call on him then. An awfully long journey,\" muttered Tantaine, as he turned away; \"but, perhaps, if I catch the worthy man in the midst of all his little business affairs, he will be more free in his language, and not so guarded in his actual admissions.\"  The old man went to his task with a will. He passed down the Rue Toumenon, skirted the Luxemburg, and made his way into the Rue Guy Lussac; from thence he walked down the Rue Mouffetard, and thence direct into one of those crooked lanes which run between the Gobelins Factory and the Hopital de l'Oursine. This is a portion of the city utterly unknown to the greater number of Parisians. The streets are narrow and hardly afford room for vehicles. A valley forms the centre of the place, down which runs a muddy, sluggish stream, the banks of which are densely crowded with tanyards and iron works. On the one side of this valley is the busy Rue Mouffetard, and on the other one of the outer boulevards, while a long line of sickly-looking poplars mark the course of the semi-stagnant stream. Tantaine seemed to know the quarter well, and went on until he reached the Champs des Alouettes. Then, with a sigh of satisfaction, he halted before a large, three-storied house, standing on a piece of ground surrounded by a mouldering wooden fence. The aspect of the house had something sinister and gloomy about it, and for a moment Tantaine paused as if he could not make up his mind to enter it; but at last he did so. The interior was as dingy and dilapidated as the outside. There were two rooms on the ground floor, one of which was strewn with straw, with a few filthy-looking quilts and blankets spread over it. The next room was fitted up as a kitchen; in the centre was a long table composed of boards placed on trestles, and a dirty-looking woman with her head enveloped in a coarse red handkerchief, and grasping a big wooden spoon, was stirring the contents of a large pot in which some terrible-looking ingredients were cooking. On a small bed in a corner lay a little boy. Every now and then a shiver convulsed his frame, his face was deadly pale, and his hands almost transparent, while his great black eyes glittered with the wild delirium of fever. Sometimes he would give a deep groan, and then the old beldame would turn angrily and threaten to strike him with her wooden spoon.  \"But I am so ill,\" pleaded the boy.  \"If you had brought home what you were told, you would not have been beaten, and then you would have had no fever,\" returned the woman harshly.  \"Ah, me! I am sick and cold, and want to go away,\" wailed the child; \"I want to see mammy.\"  Even Tantaine felt uneasy at this scene, and gave a gentle cough to announce his presence. The old woman turned round on him with an angry snarl. \"Who do you want here?\" growled she.  \"Your master.\"  \"He has not yet arrived, and may not come at all, for it is not his day; but you can see Poluche.\"  \"And who may he be?\"  \"He is the professor,\" answered the hag contemptuously.  \"And where is he?\"  \"In the music-room.\"  Tantaine went to the stairs, which were so dingy and dilapidated as to make an ascent a work of danger and difficulty. As he ascended higher, he became aware of a strange sound, something between the grinding of scissors and the snarling of cats. Then a moment's silence, a loud execration, and a cry of pain. Tantaine passed on, and coming to a rickety door, he opened it, and in another moment found himself in what the old hag downstairs had called the music-room. The partitions of all the rooms on the floor had been roughly torn down to form this apartment; hardly a pane of glass remained intact in the windows; the dingy, whitewashed walls were covered with scrawls and drawings in charcoal. A suffocating, nauseous odor rose up, absolutely overpowering the smell from the neighboring tanyards. There was no furniture except a broken chair, upon which lay a dog whip with plaited leather lash. Round the room, against the wall, stood some twenty children, dirty, and in tattered clothes. Some had violins in their hands, and others stood behind harps as tall as themselves. Upon the violins Tantaine noticed there were chalk marks at various distances. In the middle of the room was a man, tall and erect as a dart, with flat, ugly features and lank, greasy hair hanging down on his shoulders. He, too, had a violin, and was evidently giving the children a lesson. Tantaine at once guessed that this was Professor Poluche.  \"Listen,\" said he; \"here, you Ascanie, play the chorus from the _Chateau de Marguerite_.\" As he spoke he drew his bow across his instrument, while the little Savoyard did his best to imitate him, and in a squeaking voice, in nasal tone, he sang:  \"Ah! great heavens, how fine and grand Is the palace!\"  \"You young rascal!\" cried Poluche. \"Have I not bid you fifty times that at the word 'palace' you are to place your bow on the fourth chalkmark and draw it across? Begin again.\"  Once again the boy commenced, but Poluche stopped him.  \"I believe, you young villain, that you are doing it on purpose. Now, go through the whole chorus again; and if you do not do it right, look out for squalls.\"  Poor Ascanie was so muddled that he forgot all his instructions. Without any appearance of anger, the professor took up the whip and administered half a dozen severe cuts across the bare legs of the child, whose shouts soon filled the room.  \"When you are done howling,\" remarked Poluche, \"you can try again; and if you do not succeed, no supper for you to-night, my lad. Now, Giuseppe, it is your turn.\"  Giuseppe, though younger than Ascanie, was a greater proficient on the instrument, and went through his task without a single mistake.  \"Good!\" said Poluche; \"if you get on like that, you will soon be fit to go out. You would like that, I suppose?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the delighted boy, \"and I should like to bring in a few coppers too.\"  But the Professor did not waste too much time in idle converse.  \"It is your turn now, Fabio,\" said he.  Fabio, a little mite of seven, with eyes black and sparkling as those of a dormouse, had just seen Tantaine in the doorway and pointed him out to the professor.  Poluche turned quickly round and found himself face to face with Tantaine, who had come quickly forward, his hat in his hand.  Had the professor seen an apparition, he could not have started more violently, for he did not like strangers.  \"What do you want?\" asked he.  \"Reassure yourself, sir,\" said Tantaine, after having for a few seconds enjoyed his evident terror; \"I am the intimate friend of the gentleman who employs you, and have come here to discuss an important matter of business with him.\"  Poluche breathed more freely.  \"Take a chair, sir,\" said he, offering the only one in the room. \"My master will soon be here.\"  But Daddy Tantaine refused the offer, saying that he did not wish to intrude, but would wait until the lesson was over.  \"I have nearly finished,\" remarked Poluche; \"it is almost time to let these scamps have their soup.\"  Then turning to his pupils, who had not dared to stir a limb, he said,--  \"There, that is enough for to-day; you can go.\"  The children did not hesitate for a moment, but tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get away, hoping, perhaps, that he might omit to execute certain threats that he had held out during the lesson. The hope was a vain one, for the equitable Poluche went to the head of the stairs and called out in a loud voice,--  \"Mother Butor, you will give no soup to Monte and put Ravillet on half allowance.\"  Tantaine was much interested, for the scene was an entirely new one.  The professor raised his eyes to heaven.  \"Would,\" said he, \"that I might teach them the divine science as I would wish; but the master would not allow me; indeed, he would dismiss me if I attempted to do so.\"  \"I do not understand you.\"  \"Let me explain to you. You know that there are certain old women who, for a consideration, will train a linnet or a bullfinch to whistle any air?\"  Tantaine, with all humility, confessed his ignorance of these matters.  \"Well,\" said the professor, \"the only difference between those old women and myself is, that they teach birds and I boys; and I know which I had rather do.\"  Tantaine pointed to the whip.  \"And how about this?\" asked he.  Poluche shrugged his shoulders.  \"Put yourself in my place for a little while,\" remarked he. \"You see my master brings me all sorts of boys, and I have to cram music into them in the briefest period possible. Of course the child revolts, and I thrash him; but do not think he cares for this; the young imps thrive on blows. The only way that I can touch them is through their stomachs. I stop a quarter, a half, and sometimes the whole of their dinner. That fetches them, and you have no idea how a little starvation brings them on in music.\"  Daddy Tantaine felt a cold shiver creep over him as he listened to this frank exposition of the professor's mode of action.  \"You can now understand,\" remarked the professor, \"how some airs become popular in Paris. I have forty pupils all trying the same thing. I am drilling them now in the _Marguerite_, and in a little time you will have nothing else in the streets.\"  Poluche was proceeding to give Tantaine some further information, when a step was heard upon the stairs, and the professor remarked,--  \"Here is the master; he never comes up here, because he is afraid of the stairs. You had better go down to him.\"    CHAPTER XXII.  DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.  The ex-cook appeared before Tantaine in all his appalling vulgarity as the latter descended the stairs. The proprietor of the musical academy was a stout, red-faced man, with an insolent mouth and a cynical eye. He was gorgeously dressed, and wore a profusion of jewelry. He was much startled at seeing Tantaine, whom he knew to be the redoubtable Mascarin's right-hand man. \"A thousand thunders!\" muttered he. \"If these people have sent him here for me, I must take care what I am about,\" and with a friendly smile he extended his hand to Tantaine.  \"Glad to see you,\" said he. \"Now, what can I do for you, for I hope you have come to ask me to do something?\"  \"The veriest trifle,\" returned Tantaine.  \"I am sorry that it is not something of importance, for I have the greatest respect for M. Mascarin.\"  This conversation had taken place in the window, and was interrupted every moment by the shouts and laughter of the children; but beneath these sounds of merriment came an occasional bitter wail of lamentation.  \"What is that?\" inquired Perpignan, in a voice of thunder. \"Who presumes to be unhappy in this establishment?\"  \"It is two of the lads that I have put on half rations,\" returned Poluche. \"I'll make them learn somehow or----\"  A dark frown on the master's face arrested his further speech. \"What do I hear?\" roared Perpignan. \"Do you dare, under my roof, to deprive those poor children of an ounce of food? It is scandalous, I may say, infamous on your part, M. Poluche.\"  \"But, sir,\" faltered the professor, \"have you not told me hundreds of times--\"  \"That you were an idiot, and would never be anything better. Go and tell Mother Butor to give these poor children their dinner.\"  Repressing further manifestations of rage, Perpignan took Tantaine by the arm and led him into a little side-room, which he dignified by the name of his office. There was nothing in it but three chairs, a common deal table, and a few shelves containing ledgers. \"You have come on business, I presume,\" remarked Perpignan.  Tantaine nodded, and the two men seated themselves at the table, gazing keenly into each other's eyes, as though to read the thoughts that moved in the busy brain.  \"How did you find out my little establishment down here?\" asked Perpignan.  \"By a mere chance,\" remarked Tantaine carelessly. \"I go about a good deal, and hear many things. For instance, you have taken every precaution here, and though you are really the proprietor, yet the husband of your cook and housekeeper, Butor, is supposed to be the owner of the house--at least it stands in his name. Now, if anything untoward happened, you would vanish, and only Butor would remain a prey for the police.\"  Tantaine paused for a moment, and then slowly added, \"Such tactics usually succeed unless a man has some secret enemy, who would take advantage of his knowledge, to do him an injury by obtaining irrefragable proofs of his complicity.\"  The ex-cook easily perceived the threat that was hidden under these words. \"They know something,\" muttered he, \"and I must find out what it is.\"  \"If a man has a clear conscience,\" said he aloud, \"he is all right. I have nothing to conceal, and therefore nothing to fear. You have now seen my establishment; what do you think of it?\"  \"It seems to me a very well-conducted one.\"  \"It may have occurred to you that a factory at Roubaix might have been a better investment, but I had not the capital to begin with.\"  Tantaine nodded. \"It is not half a bad trade,\" said he.  \"I agree with you. In the Rue St. Marguerite you will find more than one similar establishment; but I never cared for the situation of the Faubourg St. Antoine. My little angels find this spot more salubrious.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" answered Tantaine amicably, \"and if they howl too much when they are corrected, there are not too many neighbors to hear them.\"  Perpignan thought it best to take no notice of this observation. \"The papers are always pitching into us,\" continued he. \"They had much better stick to politics. The fact is, that the profits of our business are tremendously exaggerated.\"  \"Well, you manage to make a living out of it?\"  \"I don't lose, I confess, but I have six little cherubs in hospital, besides the one in the kitchen, and these, of course, are a dead loss to me.\"  \"That is a sad thing for you,\" answered Tantaine gravely.  Perpignan began to be amazed at his visitor's coolness.  \"Damn it all,\" said he, \"if you and Mascarin think the business such a profitable one, why don't you go in for it. You may perhaps think it easy to procure the kids; just try it. You have to go to Italy for most of them, then you have to smuggle them across the frontier like bales of contraband goods.\"  Perpignan paused to take a breath, and Tantaine asked,--  \"What sum do you make each of the lads bring in daily?\"  \"That depends,\" answered Perpignan hesitatingly.  \"Well, you can give an average?\"  \"Say three francs then.\"  \"Three francs!\" repeated Tantaine with a genial smile, \"and you have forty little cherubs, so that makes one hundred and twenty francs per day.\"  \"Absurd!\" retorted Perpignan; \"do you think each of the lads bring in such a sum as that?\"  \"Ah! you know the way to make them do so.\"  \"I don't understand you,\" answered Perpignan, in whose voice a shade of anxiety now began to appear.  \"No offence, no offence,\" answered Tantaine; \"but the fact is, the newspapers are doing you a great deal of harm, by retailing some of the means adopted by your colleague to make the boys do a good day's work. Do you recollect the sentence on that master who tied one of his lads down on a bed, and left him without food for two days at a stretch?\"  \"I don't care about such matters; no one can bring a charge of cruelty against me,\" retorted Perpignan angrily.  \"A man with the kindest heart in the world may be the victim of circumstances.\"  Perpignan felt that the decisive moment was at hand.  \"What do you mean?\" asked he.  \"Well, suppose, to punish one of your refractory lads, you were to shut him in the cellar. A storm comes on during the night, the gutter gets choked up, the cellar fills with water, and next morning you find the little cherub drowned like a rat in his hole?\"  Perpignan's face was livid.  \"Well, and what then?\" asked he.  \"Ah! now the awkward part of the matter comes. You would not care to send for the police, that might excite suspicion; the easiest thing is to dig a hole and shove the body into it.\"  Perpignan got up and placed his back against the door.  \"You know too much, M. Tantaine,--a great deal too much,\" said he.  Perpignan's manner was most threatening; but Tantaine still smiled pleasantly, like a child who had just committed some simply mischievous act, the results of which it cannot foresee.  \"The sentence isn't heavy,\" he continued; \"five years' penal servitude, if evidence of previous good conduct could be put in; but if former antecedents were disclosed, such as a journey to Nancy----\"  This was the last straw, and Perpignan broke out,--  \"What do you mean?\" said he; \"and what do you want me to do?\"  \"Only a trifling service, as I told you before. My dear sir, do not put yourself in a rage,\" he added, as Perpignan seemed disposed to speak again. \"Was it not you who first began to talk of your, 'em--well, let us say business?\"  \"Then you wanted to make yourself agreeable by talking all this rot to me. Well, shall I tell you in my turn what I think?\"  \"By all means, if it will not be giving you too much trouble.\"  \"Then I tell you that you have come here on an errand which no man should venture to do alone. You are not of the age and build for business like this. It is a misfortune--a fatal one perhaps--to put yourself in my power, in such a house as this.\"  \"But, my dear sir, what is likely to happen to me?\"  The features of the ex-cook were convulsed with fury; he was in that mad state of rage in which a man has no control over himself. Mechanically his hand slipped into his pocket; but before he could draw it out again, Tantaine who had not lost one of his movements, sprang upon him and grasped him so tightly by the throat that he was powerless to adopt any offensive measures, in spite of his great strength and robust build. The struggle was not a long one; the old man hurled his adversary to the ground, and placed his foot on his chest, and held him down, his whole face and figure seemingly transfigured with the glories of strength and success.  \"And so you wished to stab me,--to murder a poor and inoffensive old man. Do you think that I was fool enough to enter your cut-throat door without taking proper precautions?\" And as he spoke he drew a revolver from his bosom. \"Throw away your knife,\" added he sternly.  In obedience to this mandate, Perpignan, who was now entirely demoralized, threw the sharp-pointed weapon which he had contrived to open in his pocket into a corner of the room.  \"Good,\" said Tantaine. \"You are growing more reasonable now. Of course I came alone, but do you think that plenty of people did not know where I was going to? Had I not returned to-night, do you think that my master, M. Mascarin, would have been satisfied? and how long do you think it would have been before he and the police would have been here. If you do not do all that I wish for the rest of your life, you will be the most ungrateful fellow in the world.\"  Perpignan was deeply mortified; he had been worsted in single combat, and now he was being found out, and these things had never happened to him before.  \"Well, I suppose that I must give in,\" answered he sulkily.  \"Quite so; it is a pity that you did not think of that before.\"  \"You vexed me and made me angry.\"  \"Just so; well, now, get up, take that chair, and let us talk reasonably.\"  Perpignan obeyed without a word.  \"Now,\" said Tantaine, \"I came here with a really magnificent proposal. But I adopted the course I pursued because I wished to prove to you that _you_ belonged more absolutely to Mascarin than did your wretched foreign slaves to you. You are absolutely at his mercy, and he can crush you to powder whenever he likes.\"  \"Your Mascarin is Satan himself,\" muttered the discomfited man. \"Who can resist him?\"  \"Come, as you think thus, we can talk sensibly at last.\"  \"Well,\" answered Perpignan ruefully, as he adjusted his disordered necktie, \"say what you like, I have no answer to make.\"  \"Let us begin at the commencement,\" said Tantaine. \"For some days past your people have been following a certain Caroline Schimmel. A fellow of sixteen called Ambrose, a lad with a harp, was told off for this duty. He is not to be trusted. Only a night or two ago one of my men made him drunk; and fearing lest his absence might create surprise, drove him here in a cab, and left him at the corner.\"  The ex-cook uttered an oath.  \"Then you too are watching Caroline,\" said he. \"I knew well that there was some one else in the field, but that was no matter of mine.\"  \"Well, tell me why you are watching her?\"  \"How can you ask me? You know that my motto is silence and discretion, and that this is a secret intrusted to my honor.\"  Tantaine shrugged his shoulders.  \"Why do you talk like that, when you know very well that you are following Ambrose on your own account, hoping by that means to penetrate a secret, only a small portion of which has been intrusted to you?\" remarked he.  \"Are you certain of this statement?\" asked the man, with a cunning look.  \"So sure that I can tell you that the matter was placed in your hands by a certain M. Catenac.\"  The expression in Perpignan's face changed from astonishment to fear.  \"Why, this Mascarin knows everything,\" muttered he.  \"No,\" replied Tantaine, \"my master does not know everything, and the proof of this is, that I have come to ask you what occurred between Catenac's client and yourself, and this is the service that we expect from you.\"  \"Well, if I must, I must. About three weeks ago, one morning, I had just finished with half a dozen clients at my office in the Rue de Fame, when my servant brought me Catenac's card. After some talk, he asked me if I could find out a person that he had utterly lost sight of. Of course I said, yes, I could. Upon this he asked me to make an appointment for ten the next morning, when some one would call on me regarding the affair. At the appointed time a shabbily dressed man was shown in. I looked at him up and down, and saw that, in spite of his greasy hat and threadbare coat, his linen was of the finest kind, and that his shoes were the work of one of our best bootmakers. 'Aha,' said I to myself, 'you thought to take me in, did you!' I handed him a chair, and he at once proceeded to let me into his reasons for coming. 'Sir,' said he, 'my life has not been a very happy one, and once I was compelled to take to the Foundling Asylum a child that I loved very dearly, the son of a woman whom I adored. She is dead now, and I am old and solitary. I have a small property, and would give half of it to recover the child. Tell me, is there any chance of my doing so?' You must imagine, my dear sir,\" continued he, after a slight pause, \"that I was much interested in this story, for I said to myself, that the man's fortune must be a very small one if half of it would not amply repay me for making a journey to the Foundling Hospital. So I agreed to undertake the business, but the old fellow was too sharp for me. 'Stop a bit, and let me finish,' said he, 'and you will see that your task will not be so easy as you seem to think it.' I, of course, bragged of my enormous sources of information, and the probability of ultimate success.\"  \"Keep to your story,\" said Tantaine impatiently, \"I know all about that.\"  \"I will leave you, then, to imagine all I said to the old man, who listened to me with great satisfaction. 'I only hope that you are as skilful as M. Catenac says you are, and have as much influence and power as you assert, for no man has a finer chance than you now have. I have tried all means up to this, but I have failed.' I went first to the hospital where the child had been placed, and they showed me the register containing the date of his admission, but no one knew what had become of him, for at twelve years of age he had left the place, and no one had heard of him since; and in spite of every effort, I have been unable to discover whether he is alive or dead.\"  \"A pretty riddle to guess,\" remarked Tantaine.  \"An enigma that it is impossible to solve,\" returned Perpignan. \"How is one to get hold of a boy who vanished ten years ago, and who must now be a grown-up man?\"  \"We could do it.\"  Tantaine's tone was so decided, that the other man looked sharply at him with a vague suspicion rising in his breast that the affair had also been placed in Mascarin's hands; and if so, whether he had worked it with more success than himself.  \"You might, for all I know; but I felt that the clue was absolutely wanting,\" answered Perpignan sulkily. \"I put on a bold face, however, and asked for the boy's description. The man told me that he could provide me with an accurate one, for that many people, notably the lady superior, remembered the lad. He could also give other details which might be useful.\"  \"And these you obtained, of course?\"  \"Not yet.\"  \"Are you joking?\"  \"Not a bit. I do not know whether the old man was sharp enough to read in the expression of my features that I had not the smallest hope of success; be that as it may, he could give me no further information that day, declaring that he came in only to consult me, and that everything must be done in a most confidential way. I hastened to assure him that my office was a perfect tomb of secrets. He told me that he took that for granted. Then telling me that he wished me to draw up a _precis_ of my intended course, he took out a note for five hundred francs, which he handed to me for my time. I refused to take it, though it cost me a struggle to do so, for I thought that I should make more out of him later on. But he insisted on my taking it, saying that he would see me again soon, and that Catenac would communicate with me. He left me less interested in the search than in who this old man could possibly be.\"  Tantaine felt that Perpignan was telling the truth.  \"Did you not try and find out that?\" asked he.  Perpignan hesitated; but feeling convinced that there was no loophole for escape, he answered, \"Hardly had my visitor left than, slipping on a cap and a workman's blouse, I followed him in his track, and saw him enter one of the finest houses in the Rue de Varennes.\"  \"He lived there then?\"  \"He did, and he was a very well-known man--the Duke de Champdoce.\"  \"Yes, I know all that,\" answered Tantaine, placidly, \"but I can't, for the life of me, imagine the connection between the Duke and Caroline Schimmel.\"  Perpignan raised his eyebrows.  \"Why did you put a man to watch her?\" asked Tantaine.  \"My reasons for doing so were most simple. I made every inquiry regarding the Duke; learned that he was very wealthy, and lived a very steady life. He is married, and loves his wife dearly. They had one son, whom they lost a year ago, and have never recovered from the shock. I imagine that this Duke, having lost his legitimate heir, wished me to find his other son. Do you not think that I am right?\"  \"There is something in it; but, after all, you have not explained your reasons for watching Caroline.\"  Perpignan was no match for Mascarin's right-hand man, but he was keen enough to discern that Tantaine was putting a string of questions to him which had been prepared in advance. This he, however, was powerless to resent.  \"As you may believe,\" said he, \"I made every inquiry into the past as well as the present of the Duke, and also tried to discover who was the mother of the child, but in this I entirely failed.\"  \"What! not with all your means?\" cried Tantaine, with a sneer.  \"Laugh at me as much as you like; but out of the thirty servants in the Champdoce establishment, not one has been there more than ten years. Nor could I anywhere lay my hands upon one who had been in the Duke's service in his youth. Once, however, as I was in the wineshop in the Rue de Varennes, I quite by chance heard allusion made to a woman who had been in the service of the Duke twenty-five years ago, and who was now in receipt of a small allowance from him. This woman was Caroline Schimmel. I easily found out her address, and set a watch on her.\"  \"And of what use will she be to you?\"  \"Very little, I fear. And yet the allowance looks as if she had at one time done something out of the way for her employers. Can it be that she has any knowledge of the birth of this natural child?\"  \"I don't think much of your idea,\" returned Tantaine carelessly.  \"Since then,\" continued Perpignan, \"the Duke has never put in an appearance in my office.\"  \"But how about Catenac?\"  \"I have seen him three times.\"  \"Has he told you nothing more? Do you not even know in which hospital the child was placed?\"  \"No; and on my last visit I plainly told him that I was getting sick of all this mystery; and he said that he himself was tired, and was sorry that he had ever meddled in the affair.\"  Tantaine was not surprised at hearing this, and accounted for Catenac's change of front by the threats of Mascarin.  \"Well, what do you draw from this?\" asked he.  \"That Catenac has no more information than I have. The Duke most likely proposes to drop the affair; but, were I in his place, I should be afraid to find the boy, however much I might at one time have desired to do so. He may be in prison--the most likely thing for a lad who, at twelve years of age, ran away from a place where he was well treated. I have, however, planned a mode of operation, for, with patience, money, and skill, much might be done.\"  \"I agree with you.\"  \"Then let me tell you. I have drawn an imaginary circle round Paris. I said to myself, 'I will visit every house and inn in the villages round within this radius; I will enter every isolated dwelling, and will say to the inhabitants, \"Do any of you remember at any time sheltering and feeding a child, dressed in such and such a manner?\"' giving at the same time a description of him. I am sure that I should find some one who would answer in the affirmative. Then I should gain a clue which I would follow up to the end.\"  This plan appeared so ingenious to Tantaine, that he involuntarily exclaimed,--  \"Good! excellent!\"  Perpignan hardly knew whether Tantaine was praising or blaming him. His manner might have meant either.  \"You are very fast,\" returned he dismally. \"Perhaps presently you will be good enough to allow that I am not an absolute fool. Do you really think that I am an idiot? At any rate, I sometimes hit upon a judicious combination. For example, with regard to this boy, I have a notion which, if properly worked might lead to something.\"  \"Might I ask what it is?\"  \"I speak confidentially. If it is impossible to lay our hands upon the real boy, why should we not substitute another?\"  At this suggestion, Tantaine started violently.  \"It would be most dangerous, most hazardous,\" gasped he.  \"You are afraid, then?\" said Perpignan, delighted at the effect his proposal had made.  \"It seems it is you who were afraid,\" retorted Tantaine.  \"You do not know me when you say that,\" said Perpignan.  \"If you were not afraid,\" asked Tantaine, in his most oily voice, \"why did you not carry out your plan?\"  \"Because there was one obstacle that could not be got over.\"  \"Well, I can't see it myself,\" returned Tantaine, desirous of hearing every detail.  \"Ah, there is one thing that I omitted in my narrative. The Duke informed me that he could prove the identity of the boy by certain scars.\"  \"Scars? And of what kind, pray?\"  \"Now you are asking me too much. I do not know.\"  On receiving this reply, Tantaine rose hastily from his chair, and thus concealed his agitation from his companion.  \"I have a hundred apologies to make for taking up so much of your valuable time. My master has got it into his head that you were after the same game as ourselves. He was mistaken, and now we leave the field clear to you.\"  Before Perpignan could make any reply, the old man had passed through the doorway. On the threshold he paused, and said,--  \"Were I in your place, I would stick to my first plan. You will never find the boy, but you will get several thousand francs out of the Duke, which I am sure will come in handy.\"  \"There are scars now, then,\" muttered Tantaine, as he moved away from the house, \"and that Master Catenac never said a word about them!\"    CHAPTER XXIII.  FATHER AND SON.  Two hours after Andre had left the Avenue de Matignon, one of Mascarin's most trusty emissaries was at his heels, who could watch his actions with the tenacity of a bloodhound. Andre, however, now that he had heard of Sabine's convalescence, had entirely recovered the elasticity of his spirits, and would never have noticed that he was being followed. His heart, too, was much rejoiced at the friendship of M. de Breulh and the promise of assistance from the Viscountess de Bois Arden; and with the assistance of these two, he felt that he could end his difficulties.  \"I must get to work again,\" muttered he, as he left M. de Breulh's hospitable house. \"I have already lost too much time. To-morrow, if you look up at the scaffolding of a splendid house in the Champs Elysees, you will see me at work.\"  Andre was busy all night with his plans for the rich contractor, M. Gandelu, who wanted as much ornamental work on the outside of his house as he had florid decorations within. He rose with the lark, and having gazed for a moment on Sabine's portrait, started for the abode of M. Gandelu, the proud father of young Gaston. This celebrated contractor lived in a splendid house in the Rue Chasse d'Antin, until his more palatial residence should be completed.  When Andre presented himself at the door, an old servant, who knew him well, strongly urged him not to go up.  \"Never,\" said he, \"in all the time that I have been with master, have I seen him in such a towering rage. Only just listen!\"  It was easy to hear the noise alluded to, mingled with the breaking of glass and the smashing of furniture.  \"The master has been at this game for over an hour,\" remarked the servant, \"ever since his lawyer, M. Catenac, has left him.\"  Andre, however, decided not to postpone his visit. \"I must see him in spite of everything; show me up,\" said he.  With evident reluctance the domestic obeyed, and threw open the door of a room superbly furnished and decorated, in the centre of which stood M. Gandelu waving the leg of a chair frantically in his hand. He was a man of sixty years of age, but did not look fifty, built like a Hercules, with huge hands and muscular limbs which seemed to fret under the restraint of his fashionable garments. He had made his enormous fortune, of which he was considerably proud, by honest labor, and no one could say that he had not acted fairly throughout his whole career. He was coarse and violent in his manner, but he had a generous heart and never refused aid to the deserving and needy. He swore like a trooper, and his grammar was faulty; but for all that, his heart was in the right place, and he was a better man than many who boast of high birth and expensive education.  \"What idiot is coming here to annoy me?\" roared he, as soon as the door was opened.  \"I have come by appointment,\" answered Andre, and the contractor's brow cleared as he saw who his visitor was.  \"Ah, it is you, is it? Take a seat; that is, if there is a sound chair left in the room. I like you, for you have an honest face and don't shirk hard work. You needn't color up, though; modesty is no fault. Yes, there is something in you, and when you want a hundred thousand francs to go into business with, here it is ready for you; and had I a daughter, you should marry her, and I would build your house for you.\"  \"I thank you much,\" said Andre; \"but I have learned to depend entirely on myself.\"  \"True,\" returned Gandelu, \"you never knew your parents; you never knew what a kind father would do for his child. Do you know my son?\" asked he, suddenly turning upon Andre.  This question at once gave Andre the solution of the scene before him. M. Gandelu was irritated at some folly that his son had committed. For a moment Andre hesitated; he did not care to say anything that might revive the old man's feeling of anger, and therefore merely replied that he had only met his son Gaston two or three times.  \"Gaston,\" cried the old man, with a bitter oath; \"do not call him that. Do you think it likely that old Nicholas Gandelu would ever have been ass enough to call his son Gaston? He was called Peter, after his grandfather, but it wasn't a good enough one for the young fool; he wanted a swell name, and Peter had too much the savor of hard work in it for my fine gentleman. But that isn't all; I could let that pass,\" continued the old man. \"Pray have you seen his cards? Over the name of Gaston de Gandelu is a count's coronet. He a count indeed! the son of a man who has carried a hod for years!\"  \"Young people will be young people,\" Andre ventured to observe; but the old man's wrath would not be assuaged by a platitude like this.  \"You can find no excuse for him, only the fellow is absolutely ashamed of his father. He consorts with titled fools and is in the seventh heaven if a waiter addresses him as 'Count,' not seeing that it is not he that is treated with respect, but the gold pieces of his old father, the working man.\"  Andre's position was now a most painful one, and he would have given a good deal not to be the recipient of a confidence which was the result of anger.  \"He is only twenty, and yet see what a wreck he is,\" resumed Gandelu. \"His eyes are dim, and he is getting bald; he stoops, and spends his nights in drink and bad company. I have, however, only myself to blame, for I have been far too lenient; and if he had asked me for my head, I believe that I should have given it to him. He had only to ask and have. After my wife's death, I had only the boy. Do you know what he has in this house? Why, rooms fit for a prince, two servants and four horses. I allow him monthly, fifteen hundred francs, and he goes about calling me a niggard, and has already squandered every bit of his poor mother's fortune.\" He stopped, and turned pale, for at that moment the door opened, and young Gaston, or rather Peter, slouched into the room.  \"It is the common fate of fathers to be disappointed in their offspring, and to see the sons who ought to have been their honor and glory the scourge to punish their worldly aspirations,\" exclaimed the old man.  \"Good! that is really a very telling speech,\" murmured Gaston approvingly, \"considering that you have not made a special study of elocution.\"  Fortunately his father did not catch these words, and continued in a voice broken by emotion, \"That, M. Andre, is my son, who for twenty years has been my sole care. Well, believe it or not, as you like, he has been speculating on my death, as you might speculate on a race-horse at Vincennes.\"  \"No, no,\" put in Gaston, but his father stopped him with a disdainful gesture.  \"Have at least the courage to acknowledge your fault. You thought me blind because I said nothing, but your past conduct has opened my eyes.\"  \"But, father!\"  \"Do not attempt to deny it. This very morning my man of business, M. Catenac, wrote to me, and with that real courage which only true friends possess, told me all. I must tell you, M. Andre,\" resumed the contractor, \"I was ill. I had a severe attack of the gout, such as a man seldom recovers from, and my son was constant in his attendance at my sick couch. This consoled me. 'He loves me after all,' said I. But it was only my testamentary arrangements that he wanted to discover, and he went straight to a money-lender called Clergot and raised a hundred thousand francs assuring the blood-sucker that I had not many hours to live.\"  \"It is a lie!\" cried Gaston, his face crimsoning with shame.  The old man raised the leg of the chair in his hand, and made so threatening a movement that Andre flung himself between father and son. \"Great heavens!\" cried he, \"think what you are doing, sir, and forbear.\"  The old man paused, passed his hand round his brow, and flung the weapon into a remote corner of the room. \"I thank you,\" said he, grasping Andre's hand; \"you have saved me from a great crime. In another moment I should have murdered him.\"  Gaston was no coward, and he still retained the position he had been in before.  \"This is quite romantic,\" muttered he. \"The governor seems to be going in for infanticide.\"  Andre did not allow him to finish the sentence, for, grasping the young man's wrist, he whispered fiercely, \"Not another word; silence!\"  \"But I want to know what it all means?\" answered the irrepressible youth.  \"I had in my hands,\" said the old man, addressing Andre, and ignoring the presence of his son, \"the important paper he had copied. Yes; not more than an hour ago I read it. These were the terms: if I died within eight days from the date of signature, my son agreed to pay a bonus of thirty thousand francs; but if I lived for one month, he would take up the bill by paying one hundred and fifty thousand. If, however, by any unforeseen chance, I should recover entirely, he bound himself to pay Clergot the hundred thousand francs.\"  The old man tore the cravat from his swelling throat, and wiped the beads of cold sweat that bedewed his brow.  \"When this man recovers his self-command,\" thought Andre, \"he will never forgive me for having been the involuntary listener to this terrible tale.\" But in this Andre was mistaken, for unsophisticated nature requires sympathy, and Nichols Gandelu would have said the same to the first comer.  \"Before, however, delivering the hundred thousand francs, the usurer wished to make himself more secure, and asked for a certificate from some one who had seen me. This person was his friend. He spoke to me of a medical man, a specialist, who would understand my case at once. Would I not see him? Never had I seen my son so tender and affectionate. I yielded to his entreaties at last, and one evening I said to him, 'Bring in this wonderful physician, if you really think he can do anything for me,' and he did bring him.  \"Yes, M. Andre, he found a medical man base and vile enough to become the tool of my son, and a money-lender; and if I choose, I can expose him to the loathing of the world, and the contempt of his brethren.  \"The fellow came, and his visit lasted nearly an hour. I can see him now, asking questions and feeling my pulse. He went away at last, and my son followed him. They both met Clergot, who was waiting in the street. 'You can pay him the cash; the old man won't last twenty-four hours longer,' said the doctor; and then my son came back happy and radiant, and assured me that I should soon be well again. And strange as it may seem, a change for the better took place that very night. Clergot had asked for forty-eight hours in which to raise the sum required. He heard of my convalescence, and my son lost the money.  \"Was it courage you lacked?\" asked the old man, turning for the first time to his son. \"Did you not know that ten drops instead of one of the medicine I was taking would have freed you from me for ever?\"  Gaston did not seem at all overwhelmed. Indeed, he was wondering how the matter had reached his father's ears, and how Catenac had discovered the rough draft of the agreement.  The contractor had imagined that his son would implore forgiveness; but seeing that he remained obdurate, his violence burst forth again. \"And do you know what use my son would make of my fortune? He would squander it on a creature he picked up out of the streets,--a woman he called Madame de Chantemille,--a fit companion for a noble count!\"  The shaft had penetrated the impassability which Gaston had up to this displayed. \"You should not insult Zora,\" said he.  \"I shall not,\" returned his father with a grim laugh, \"take the trouble to do that; you are not of age, and I shall clap your friend Madame de Chantemille into prison.\"  \"You would not do that!\"  \"Would I not? You are a minor; but your Zora, whose real name is Rose, is much older; the law is wholly on my side.\"  \"But father--\"  \"There is no use in crying; my lawyer has the matter in hand, and by nightfall your Zora will be securely caged.\"  This blow was so cruel and unexpected, that the young man could only repeat,--  \"Zora in prison!\"  \"Yes, in the House of Correction, and from thence to Saint Lazare. Catenac told me the very things to be done.\"  \"Shameful!\" exclaimed Gaston, \"Zora in prison! Why, I and my friends will lay siege to the place. I will go to the Court, stand by her side, and depose that this all comes from your devilish malignity. I will say that I love and esteem her, and that as soon as I am of age I will marry her; the papers will write about us. Go on, go on; I rather like the idea.\"  However great a man's self-control may be, it has its limits. M. Gandelu had restrained himself even while he told his son of his villainous conduct; but these revolting threats were more than he could endure, and Andre seeing this, stepped forward, opened the door, and thrust the foolish youth into the corridor.  \"What have you done\" cried the contractor; \"do you not see that he will go and warn that vile creature, and that she will escape from justice?\"  And as Andre, fearing he knew not what, tried to restrain him, the old man, exerting all his muscular strength, thrust him on one side with perfect ease, and rushed from the room, calling loudly to his servants.  Andre was horrified at the scene at which, in spite of himself, he had been compelled to assist as a witness. He was not a fool, and had lived too much in the world of art not to have witnessed many strange scenes and met with many dissolute characters; but, as a rule, the follies of the world had amused rather than disgusted him. But this display of want of feeling on the part of a son toward a father absolutely chilled his blood. In a few minutes M. Gandelu appeared with a calmer expression upon his face.  \"I will tell you how matters now stand,\" said he, in a voice that quivered in spite of his efforts. \"My son is locked up in his room, and a trustworthy servant whom he cannot corrupt has mounted guard over him.\"  \"Do you not fear, sir, that in his excitement and anger he may----?\"  The contractor shrugged his shoulders.  \"You do not know him,\" answered he, \"if you imagine that he resembles me in any way. What do you think that he is doing now? Lying on his bed, face downward, yelling for his Zora. Zora, indeed! As if that was a name fit for a Christian. How is it that these creatures are enabled to drug our boys and lead them anywhere? Had his mother not been a saint on earth, I should scarcely believe that he was my son.\"  The contractor sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.  \"You are in pain, sir?\" said Andre.  \"Yes; my heart is deeply wounded. Up to this time I have only felt as a father; now I feel as a man. To-morrow I send for my family and consult with them; and I shall advertise that for the future I will not be responsible for any debts that my son may contract. He shall not have a penny, and will soon learn how society treats a man with empty pockets. As to the girl, she will disappear in double quick time. I have thoroughly weighed the consequences of sending this girl to gaol, and they are very terrible. My son will do as he has threatened, I am sure of that; and I can picture him tied to that infamous creature for life, looking into her face, and telling her that he adores her, and glorying in his dishonor, which will be repeated by every Parisian newspaper.\"  \"But is there no other way of proceeding?\" asked Andre.  \"No, none whatever. If all modern fathers had my courage, we should not have so many profligate sons. It is impossible that this conferring with the doctor and the money-lender could have originated in my son's weak brain. He is a mere child, and some one must have put him up to it.\"  The poor father was already seeking for some excuse for the son's conduct.  \"I must not dwell on this longer,\" continued Gandelu, \"or I shall get as mad as I was before. I will look at your plans another day. Now, let us get out of the house. Come and look at the new building in the Champs Elysees.\"  The mansion in question was situated at the corner of the Rue de Chantilly, near the Avenue des Champs Elysees, and the frontage of it was still marked by scaffolding, so that but little of it could be seen. A dozen workmen, engaged by Andre, were lounging about. They had expected to see him early, and were surprised at his non-appearance, as he was usually punctuality itself. Andre greeted them in a friendly manner, but M. Gandelu, though he was always on friendly terms with his workmen, passed by them as if he did not even notice their existence. He walked through the different rooms and examined them carelessly, without seeming to take any interest in them, for his thoughts were with his son,--his only son.  After a short time he returned to Andre.  \"I cannot stay longer,\" said he; \"I am not feeling well; I will be here to-morrow;\" and he went away with his head bent down on his chest.  The workmen noticed his strange and unusual manner.  \"He does not look very bright,\" remarked one to his comrade. \"Since his illness he has not been the same man. I think he must have had some terrible shock.\"    CHAPTER XXIV.  AN ARTFUL TRICK.  Andre had removed his coat and donned his blouse, the sleeves of which were rolled up to his shoulders. \"I must get to business,\" murmured he, \"to make up for lost time.\" He set to work with great vigor, but had hardly got into the swing, when a lad came actively up the ladder and told him that a gentleman wished to see him, \"and a real swell, too,\" added the boy. Andre was a good deal put out at being disturbed, but when he reached the street and saw that it was M. de Breulh-Faverlay who was waiting for him, his ill-humor disappeared like chaff before the wind.  \"Ah, this is really kind of you,\" cried he; for he could never forget the debt of gratitude he owed to the gentleman. \"A thousand thanks for remembering me. Excuse my not shaking hands, but see;\" and he exhibited his palms all white with plaster. As he did so the smile died away on his lips, for he caught sight of his friend's face.  \"What is the matter?\" exclaimed he, anxiously. \"Is Sabine worse? Has she had a relapse?\"  De Breulh shook his head, but the expression of his face clearly said,--  \"Would to heavens it were only that!\"  But the news that Sabine was not worse relieved Andre at once, and he patiently waited for his friend to explain.  \"I have seen her twice for you,\" answered De Breulh; \"but it is absolutely necessary that you should come to a prompt decision on an important affair.\"  \"I am quite at your service,\" returned Andre a good deal surprised and troubled.  \"Then come with me at once, I did not drive here, but we shall not be more than a quarter of an hour in reaching my house.\"  \"I will follow you almost immediately. I only ask five minutes' grace to go up to the scaffold again.\"  \"Have you any orders to give?\"  \"No, I have none.\"  \"Why should you go, then?\"  \"To make myself a little more presentable.\"  \"Is it an annoyance or inconvenience for you to go out in that dress?\"  \"Not a bit, I am thoroughly used to it; but it was for your sake.\"  \"If that is all, come along.\"  \"But people will stare at seeing you in company with a common workman.\"  \"Let them stare.\" And drawing Andre's arm through his, M. de Breulh set off.  Andre was right; many persons did turn round to look at the fashionably dressed gentleman walking arm in arm with a mason in his working attire, but De Breulh took but little heed, and to all Andre's questions simply said, \"Wait till we reach my house.\"  At length they arrived, without having exchanged twenty words, and entering the library closed the door. M. de Breulh did not inflict the torture of suspense upon his young friend a moment longer than was necessary.  \"This morning, about twelve o'clock, as I was crossing the Avenue de Matignon, I saw Modeste, who had been waiting for you more than an hour.\"  \"I could not help it.\"  \"I know that. As soon as she saw me, she ran up to me at once. She was terribly disappointed at not having seen you; but knowing our intimacy, she intrusted me with a letter for you from Mademoiselle de Mussidan.\"  Andre shuddered; he felt that the note contained evil tidings, with which De Breulh was already acquainted. \"Give it to me,\" said he, and with trembling hands he tore open the letter and perused its contents.  \"DEAREST ANDRE,--  \"I love you, and shall ever continue to do so, but I have duties--most holy ones--which I must fulfil; duties which my name and position demand of me, even should the act cost me my life. We shall never meet again in this world, and this letter is the last one you will ever receive from me. Before long you will see the announcement of my marriage. Pity me, for great as your wretchedness will be, it will be as nothing compared to mine. Heaven have mercy upon us both! Andre, try and tear me out of your heart. I have not even the right to die, and oh, my darling, this--this is the last word you will ever receive from your poor unhappy  \"SABINE.\"   If M. de Breulh had insisted upon taking Andre home with him before he handed him the letter, it was because Modeste had given him some inkling of its contents. He feared that the effect would be tremendous upon nerves so highly strung and sensitive as those of Andre. But he need not have been alarmed on this point. As the young painter mastered the contents of the letter his features became ghastly pale, and a shudder convulsed every nerve and muscle of his frame. With a mechanical gesture he extended the paper to M. de Breulh, uttering the one word, \"Read.\"  His friend obeyed him, more alarmed by Andre's laconism than he could have been by some sudden explosion of passion.  \"Do not lose heart,\" exclaimed he.  But Andre interrupted him. \"Lose heart!\" said he; \"you do not know me. When Sabine was ill, perhaps dying, far away from me, I did feel cast down; but now that she tells me that she loves me, my feelings are of an entirely different nature.\"  M. de Breulh was about to speak, but Andre went on.  \"What is this marriage contract which my poor Sabine announces to me, as if it was her death-warrant? Her parents must all along have intended to break with you, but you were beforehand with them. Can they have received a more advantageous offer of marriage already? It is scarcely likely. When she confided the secret of her life to you, she certainly knew nothing of this. What terrible event has happened since then? My brave Sabine would never have submitted unless some coercion had been used that she could not struggle against; she would rather have quitted her father's house for ever.\"  As Andre uttered these words De Breulh's mind was busy with similar reflections, for Modeste had given him some hint of the approaching marriage, and had begged him to be most careful how he communicated the facts to Andre.  \"You must have noticed,\" continued the young painter, \"the strange coincidence between Sabine's illness and this note. You left her happy and full of hope, and an hour afterward she falls senseless, as though struck by lightning; as soon as she recovers a little she sends me this terrible letter. Do you remember that Madame de Bois Arden told us that during Sabine's illness her father and mother never left her bedside? Was not this for fear lest some guilty secret of theirs might escape her lips in a crisis of delirium?\"  \"Yes, I remember that, and I have long had reason to imagine that there is some terrible family secret in the Mussidans' family, such as we too often find among the descendants of noble houses.\"  \"What can it be?\"  \"That I have no means of ascertaining, but that there is one I am sure.\"  Andre turned away and paced rapidly up and down the room. \"Yes,\" said he, suddenly, \"there is a mystery; but you and I will leave no stone unturned until we penetrate it.\" He drew a chair close to the side of his friend, who was reclining on a couch. \"Listen,\" said he, \"and correct me if you fancy that I am not right in what I am saying. Do you believe that the most terrible necessity alone has compelled Sabine to write this letter?\"  \"Most certainly.\"  \"Both the Count and Countess were willing to accept you as their son-in-law?\"  \"Exactly so.\"  \"Could M. de Mussidan have found a more brilliant match for his daughter, one who could unite so many advantages of experience and education to so enormous a fortune?\"  De Breulh could hardly repress a smile.  \"I am not wishing to pay you a compliment,\" said Andre impatiently. \"Reply to my question.\"  \"Very well then, I admit that according to the opinion of the world, I was a most eligible suitor, and that M. de Mussidan would find it hard to replace me.\"  \"Then tell me how it comes about that neither the Count nor the Countess has made any effort to prevent this rupture?\"  \"Their pride, perhaps, has been wounded.\"  \"Not so, for Modeste tells us that on the very day you sent the letter the Count was going to call on you to break off the engagement.\"  \"Yes, that is so, if we are to believe Modeste.\"  As if to give more emphasis to his words, Andre started to his feet. \"This,\" cried he, \"this man, who has so suddenly appeared upon the scene, will marry Sabine, not only against her own will, but against that of her parents, and for what reason? Who is this man, and what is the mysterious power that he possesses? His power is too great to spring from an honorable source. Sabine is sacrificing herself to this man for some reason or other, and he, like a dastardly cur, is ready to take advantage of the nobleness of her heart.\"  \"I admit the correctness of your supposition,\" said he; \"and now, how do you propose to act?\"  \"I shall do nothing as yet,\" answered the young man, with a fierce gleam in his eyes. \"Sabine asks me to tear her from my heart. I will affect to do so for the time. Modeste believes in me, and will help me. I have patience. The villain who has wrecked my life does not know me, and I will only reveal myself upon the day that I hold him helpless in my hand.\"  \"Take care, Andre,\" urged De Breulh; \"a false step would ruin your hopes for ever.\"  \"I will make none; as soon as I have this man's name, I will insult him; there will be a duel, and I shall kill him--or he me.\"  \"A duel will be the height of madness, and would ruin all your hopes of marriage with Sabine.\"  \"The only thing that holds me back is that I do not wish that there should be a corpse between Sabine and myself. Blood on a bridal dress, they say, brings misery; and if this man is what I suspect him to be, I should be doing him too much honor if I crossed swords with him. No, I must have a deeper vengeance than this, for I can never forget that he nearly caused Sabine's death.\"  He paused for a few seconds, and once again broke the silence which reigned in the room.  \"To abuse the power that he must possess shows what a miserable wretch he must be; and men do not attain such a height of infamy by a single bound. The course of his life must be full of similar crimes, growing deeper and deadlier as he moves on. I will make it my business to unmask him and to hold him up to the scorn and contempt of his fellow-men.\"  \"Yes; that is the plan to pursue.\"  \"And we will do so, sir. Ah! heaven help me! I say 'we,' for I have relied on you. The generous offer that you made to me I refused, and I was in the right in doing so; but I should now be a mere madman if I did not entreat you to grant me your aid and advice. We have both known hardship and are capable of going without food or sleep, if necessity requires it of us. We have both graduated in the school of poverty and sorrow. We can keep our plans to ourselves and act.\"  Andre paused, as if waiting for a reply, but his friend remained silent.  \"My plan is most simple,\" resumed the young painter. \"As soon as we know the fellow's name we shall be able to act. He will never suspect us, and we can follow him like his very shadow. There are professional detectives who, for a comparatively small sum, will lay bare a man's entire life. Are we not as clever as this fine fellow? We can work well together in our different circles; you, in the world of fashion, can pick up intelligence that I could not hope to gain; while I, from my lowly position, will study the hidden side of his life, for I can talk to the servants lounging at the front doors or the grooms at the public-houses without suspicion.\"  M. de Breulh was delighted at finding that he could have some occupation which would fill up the dreary monotony of his life.  \"I am yours!\" cried he; \"and will work with you heart and soul!\"  Before the artist could reply a loud blow was struck upon the library door, and a woman's voice exclaimed,--  \"Let me in, Gontran, at once.\"  \"It is Madame de Bois Arden,\" remarked De Breulh, drawing the bolt back; and the Viscountess rushed hastily into the room and threw herself into a low chair.  Her beautiful face was bedewed with tears, and she was in a terrible state of excitement.  \"What is the matter, Clotilde?\" asked De Breulh kindly, as he took her hand.  \"Something terrible,\" answered she with a sob; \"but you may be able to help me. Can you lend me twenty thousand francs?\"  De Breulh smiled; a heavy weight had been lifted from his heart.  \"If that is all you require, do not shed any more tears.\"  \"But I want them at once.\"  \"Can you give me half an hour?\"  \"Yes; but lose no time.\"  De Breulh drew a check and despatched his valet for the money.  \"A thousand thanks!\" said the Viscountess; \"but money is not all that I require, I want your advice.\"  Andre was about to leave the cousins together, but the lady stopped him.  \"Pray remain, M. Andre,\" said she; \"you are not at all in the way; besides, I shall have to speak of some one in whom you take a very deep interest--of Mademoiselle de Mussidan, in short.  \"I never knew such a strange occurrence,\" continued the Viscountess, recovering her spirits rapidly, \"as that to which, my dear Gontran, you owe my visit. Well, I was just going up to dress, for I had been detained by visitor after visitor, when at two o'clock another came before I could give my order, 'Not at home.' This was the Marquis de Croisenois, the brother of the man who twenty years ago disappeared in so mysterious a manner. I hardly knew him at all, though of course we have met in society, and he bows to me in the Bois, but that is all.\"  \"And yet he called on you to-day?\" remarked De Breulh.  \"Don't interrupt me,\" said the Viscountess. \"Yes, he called, and that is enough. He is good-looking, faultlessly dressed, and talks well. He brought a letter from an old friend of my grandmother's, the Marchioness d'Arlanges. She is a dear old thing, she uses awful language, and some of her stories are quite too--you know what I mean. In the letter the old lady said that the Marquis was one of her friends, and begged me for her sake to do him the service he required. Of course I asked him to be seated, and assured him that I would do anything that lay in my power. Then he began talking about M. de Clinchain, and told me a funny story about that eccentric man and a little actress, when I heard a great noise in the anteroom. I was about to ring and inquire the cause, when the door flew open and in came Van Klopen, the ladies' tailor, with a very inflamed countenance. I thought that he had come in a hurry because he had hit on something extremely fetching and wished me to be the first to see it. But do you know what the impudent fellow wanted?\"  A smile shone in De Breulh's eyes, as he answered,--  \"Money, perhaps!\"  \"You are right,\" returned the Viscountess, gravely; \"he brought my bill into my very drawing-room, and handed it in before a stranger. I never thought that a man who supplies the most aristocratic portion of society could have been guilty of such a piece of impertinence. I ordered him to leave the room, taking it for granted that he would do so with an apology, but I was wrong. He flew into a rage and threatened me, and swore that if I did not settle the bill on the spot, he would go to my husband. The bill was nearly twenty thousand francs; imagine my horror! I was so thunderstruck at the amount that I absolutely entreated him to give me time. But my humility added to his annoyance, and taking a seat in an armchair, he declared that he would not move from it until he received his money, or had seen my husband.\"  \"What was Croisenois doing all this time?\" asked M. de Breulh.  \"He did nothing at first, but at this last piece of audacity he took out his pocketbook, and throwing it in Van Klopen's face, said: 'Pay yourself, you insolent scoundrel, and get out of this.'\"  \"And the tailor went off?\"  \"No. 'I must give you a receipt,' said he, and taking writing materials from his pocket, he wrote at the foot of the bill, 'Received from the Marquis de Croisenois, on account of money owing by the Viscountess de Bois Arden, the sum of twenty thousand francs.'\"  \"Well,\" said De Breulh, looking very grave, \"and after Van Klopen's departure, I suppose Croisenois remained to ask the favor regarding which he had called?\"  \"You are mistaken,\" answered his cousin. \"I had great difficulty in making him speak; but at last he confessed that he was deeply in love with Mademoiselle de Mussidan, and entreated me to present him to her parents and exert all my influence in his behalf.\"  Both the young men started.  \"That is the man!\" cried they.  \"What do you mean?\" asked the Viscountess, looking from one to the other.  \"That your Marquis de Croisenois is a despicable scoundrel, who had imposed upon the Marchioness d'Arlanges. Just you listen to our reasons for coming to this conclusion.\" And with the most perfect clearness De Breulh had the whole state of the case before the Viscountess.  The lady listened attentively, and then said,--  \"Your premises are wrong; just let me say a word on the matter. You say that there is some man who by means of the influence that he exercises over the Count and Countess, can coerce them into granting him Sabine's hand. But, my dear Gontran, an utter stranger to the family could not exercise this power. Now M. de Croisenois has never entered the doors of the house, and came to me to ask for an introduction.\"  The justness of this remark silenced De Breulh, but Andre took another view of the matter.  \"This seems all right at a first glance, but still, after the extraordinary scene that the Viscountess has described, I should like to ask a few questions. Was not Van Klopen's behavior very unexpected?\"  \"It was brutal and infamous.\"  \"Are you not one of his best customers?\"  \"I am, and I have spent an enormous sum with him.\"  \"But Van Klopen is nasty sometimes; did he not sue Mademoiselle de Riversac?\" asked De Breulh.  \"But he did not, I expect, force his way into her drawing-room and behave outrageously before a perfect stranger. Do you know M. de Croisenois?\" returned Andre.  \"Very slightly; he is of good family, and his brother George was much esteemed by all who knew him.\"  \"Has he plenty of money?\"  \"I do not think so, but in time he will inherit a large fortune; very likely he is over head and ears in debt.\"  \"And yet he had twenty thousand francs in his pocketbook; is not that rather a large sum to carry when you are simply making a morning call? and it is curious, too, that it should have been the exact sum wanted. Then there is another point; the pocketbook was hurled into Van Klopen's face. Did he submit without a word to such treatment?\"  \"He certainly said nothing,\" replied Madame de Bois Arden.  \"One question more, if you please. Did Van Klopen open the book and count the notes before he gave the receipt?\"  The Viscountess thought for a moment.  \"I was a good deal excited,\" said she at length, \"but I am almost sure that I saw no notes in Van Klopen's hands.\"  Andre's face grew radiant.  \"Good, very good; he was told to pay himself, and yet he never looked to see if the money was there, but gave a receipt at once. Of course, as Van Klopen kept the pocketbook, the Marquis could have had nothing in it besides the exact sum that was required.\"  \"It does seem odd,\" muttered De Breulh.  \"But,\" said Andre, \"your bill was not exactly twenty thousand francs, was it?\"  \"No,\" answered the Viscountess. \"I ought to have had change to the amount of a hundred or a hundred and twenty francs, but I suppose he was too much excited to give it me.\"  \"But for all that he could remember that he had writing materials with him, and gave you a receipt?\"  The Viscountess was utterly bewildered.  \"And,\" continued Andre, \"how is it that Van Klopen knew De Croisenois' name? And now, lastly, where is the receipt?\"  Madame de Bois Arden turned very pale and trembled violently.  \"Ah,\" said she, \"I felt sure that something was going to happen, and it was on this very point that I wanted your advice. Well, I have not got the receipt. M. de Croisenois crumpled it up in his hand and threw it on the table. After a while, however, he took it up and put it in his pocket.\"  \"It is all perfectly clear,\" said Andre in jubilant tones; \"M. de Croisenois had need of your aid, he saw that he could not easily obtain it, and so sought to bind you by the means of a loan made to you at a time of great need.\"  \"You are right,\" said De Breulh.  The Viscountess' giddy mode of action had brought her into many scrapes, but never into so terrible a one as this.  \"Great heavens!\" cried she, \"what do you think that M. de Croisenois will do with this receipt?\"  \"He will do nothing,\" answered M. de Breulh, \"if you do everything to advance his suit; but pause for an instant, and he will show the hand of steel which has up to now been covered by the velvet glove.\"  \"I am not alarmed at a new slander?\" returned the Viscountess.  \"And why not?\" answered De Breulh. \"You know very well that in these days of lavish expenditure and unbridled luxury there are many women in society who are so basely vile that they ruin their lovers with as little compunction as their frailer sisters. To-morrow even De Croisenois may say at the club, 'On my word that little Bois Arden costs me a tremendous lot,' and hands about this receipt for twenty thousand francs. What do you imagine that people will think then?\"  \"The world knows me too well to think so ill of me.\"  \"No, no, Clotilde, there is no charity in society; they will simply say that you are his mistress, and finding that the allowance from your husband is not enough for your needs, you are ruining your lover. There will be a significant laugh among the members, and in time, a very short time, the scandal in a highly sensational form will come to the ears of your husband.\"  The Viscountess wrung her hands.  \"It is too horrible,\" wailed she. \"And do you know that Bois Arden would put the worst construction on the whole affair, for he declares that a woman will sacrifice anything in order to outshine her sex in dress. Ah, I will never run up another bill anywhere; tell me, Gontran, what I had better do. Can you not get the receipt from De Croisenois?\"  M. de Breulh paused for a moment and then replied, \"Of course I could do so, but such a step would be very damaging to your reputation. I have no proof; and if I went to him, he would deny everything of course, and it would make him your enemy for life.\"  \"Besides,\" added Andre, \"you would put him on his guard, and he would escape us.\"  The unhappy woman glanced from one to the other in utter despair.  \"Then I am lost,\" she exclaimed. \"Am I to remain for the rest of my days in this villain's power?\"  \"Not so,\" returned Andre, \"for I hope soon to put it out of M. de Croisenois' power to injure any one. What did he say when he asked you to introduce him to the Mussidans?\"  \"Nothing pointed.\"  \"Then, madame, do not disturb yourself to-night. So long as he hopes you will be useful, so long he will stay his hand. Do as he wishes; never allude to the receipt; introduce him and speak well of him, while I, aided by M. de Breulh, will do my utmost to unmask this scoundrel; and as long as he believes himself to be in perfect security, our task will be an easy one.\"  Just then the servant returned from the bank, and as soon as the man had left the room De Breulh took the notes and placed them in his cousin's hand.  \"Here is the money for De Croisenois,\" said he. \"Take my advice, and give it to him this evening with a polite letter of thanks.\"  \"A thousand thanks, Gontran; I will act as you advise.\"  \"Remember you must not allude in your letter to his introduction to the Mussidans. What do you think, Andre?\"  \"I think a receipt for the money would be a great thing,\" answered he.  \"But such a demand would arouse his suspicions.\"  \"I think not, madame, and I see a way of doing it; have you a maid upon whom you could rely?\"  \"Yes, I have one.\"  \"Good, then give the girl a letter and the notes done up in a separate parcel, and tell her exactly what she is to do. When she sees the Marquis, let her pretend to be alarmed at the great responsibility that she is incurring in carrying this large sum, and insist upon a receipt for her own protection.\"  \"There is sound sense in that,\" said De Breulh.  \"Yes, yes,\" said the Viscountess, \"Josephine will do--as sharp a girl as you could find in a day's journey--and will manage the thing admirably. Trust to me,\" she continued, as a smile of hope spread over her face; \"I will keep De Croisenois in a good humor; he will confide in me, and I will tell you everything. But, oh dear! what shall I do without Van Klopen? Why, there is not another man in Paris fit to stand in his shoes.\"  With these words the Viscountess rose to leave.  \"I am completely worn out,\" remarked she; \"and I have a dinner-party to-night. Good-bye then, until we meet again;\" and with her spirits evidently as joyous as ever, she tripped into her carriage.  \"Now,\" said Andre, as soon as they were once more alone, \"we are on the track of De Croisenois. He evidently holds Madame de Mussidan as he holds Madame de Bois Arden. His is a really honorable mode of action; he surprises a secret, and then turns extortioner.\"    CHAPTER XXV.  A NEW SKIN.  Dr. Hortebise's private arrangements were sadly upset by his being compelled to accede to the desire of Tantaine and Mascarin, and in granting hospitality to Paul Violaine; and in spite of the brilliant visions of the future, he often devoutly wished that Mascarin and his young friend were at the other side of the world; but for all that he never thought of attempting to evade the order he had received. He therefore set himself steadily to his task, endeavoring to form Paul's mind, blunt his conscience, and prepare him for the inevitable part that he would soon have to play.  Paul found in him a most affable companion, pleasant, witty, and gifted with great conversational powers. Five days were thus spent breakfasting at well-known restaurants, driving in the Bois, and dining at clubs of which the doctor was a member, while the evenings were passed at the banker's. The doctor played cards with his host, while Paul and Flavia conversed together in low whispers, or else hung over the piano together. But every kind of agreeable existence comes to an end, and one day Daddy Tantaine entered the room, his face radiant with delight.  \"I have secured you the sweetest little nest in the world,\" cried he merrily. \"It is not so fine as this, but more in accordance with your position.\"  \"Where is it?\" asked Paul.  Tantaine waited. \"You won't wear out much shoe leather,\" said he, \"in walking to a certain banker's, for your lodgings are close to his house.\"  That Tantaine had a splendid talent for arrangement Paul realized as soon as he entered his new place of abode, which was in the Rue Montmartre, and consisted of some neat, quiet rooms, just such as an artist who had conquered his first difficulties would inhabit. The apartments were on the third floor, and comprised a tiny entrance hall, sitting-room, bed and dressing room. A piano stood near the window in the sitting-room. The furniture and curtains were tasteful and in good order, but nothing was new. One thing surprised Paul very much; he had been told that the apartments had been taken and furnished three days ago, and yet it seemed as if they had been inhabited for years, and that the owner had merely stepped out a few minutes before. The unmade bed, and the half-burnt candles in the sleeping-room added to this impression, while on the rug lay a pair of worn slippers. The fire had not gone out entirely, and a half-smoked cigar lay on the mantelpiece.  On the table in the sitting-room was a sheet of music paper, with a few bars jotted down upon it. Paul felt so convinced that he was in another person's rooms, that he could not help exclaiming, \"But surely some one has been living in these chambers.\"  \"We are in your own home, my dear boy,\" said Tantaine.  \"But you took over everything, I suppose, and the original proprietor simply walked out?\"  Tantaine smiled, as though an unequivocal compliment had been paid him.  \"Why, do you not know your own home?\" asked he; \"you have been living here for the last twelve months.\"  \"I can't understand you,\" answered Paul, opening his eyes in astonishment; \"you must be jesting.\"  \"I am entirely in earnest; for more than a year you have been established here. If you want a proof of the correctness of my assertion, call up the porter.\" He ran to the head of the staircase and called out, \"Come up, Mother Brigaut.\"  In a few moments a stout old woman came panting into the room.  \"And how are you, Mother Brigaut?\" said Tantaine gayly. \"I have a word or two to say to you. You know that gentleman, do you not?\"  \"What a question? as if I did not know one of the gentlemen lodging here?\"  \"What is his name?\"  \"M. Paul.\"  \"What, plain M. Paul, and nothing else?\"  \"Well, sir, it is not his fault if he did not know his father or mother.\"  \"What does he do?\"  \"He is a musician; he gives lessons on the piano, and composes music.\"  \"Does he do a good business?\"  \"I can't say, sir, but I should guess about two or three hundred francs a month; and he makes that do, for he is economical and quiet, and as modest as a young girl.\"  Tantaine's face shone all over with satisfaction.  \"You must have known M. Paul for some time, as you seem so thoroughly acquainted with his habits?\" said he.  \"Well, I ought to, for he has been here nearly fifteen months, and all that time I have looked after his room.\"  \"Do you know where he lived before he came here?\"  \"Of course I do, for I went to inquire about him in the Rue Jacob. The people there were quite cut up at his leaving, but you see this was more handy for the music publisher in the Rue Richelieu, for whom he works.\"  \"Good, Mother Brigaut; that will do; you can leave us now.\"  As Paul listened to this brief conversation, he wondered if he was awake or asleep. Tantaine stood at the door and watched the woman down stairs; then he closed it carefully, and coming up to Paul, said,--  \"Well, what do you think of all this?\"  At first Paul was so astounded that he could hardly find words in which to express himself; but he remembered the words that Dr. Hortebise had so often dinned into his ears during the last five days,--  \"Let nothing astonish you.\"  \"I suppose,\" said he at last, \"that you had taught this old woman her lesson beforehand.\"  \"Merciful powers!\" exclaimed Tantaine in tones of extreme disgust. \"If these are all the ideas you have gained from what you have heard, our task will not be by any means an easy one.\"  Paul was wounded by Tantaine's contemptuous manner.  \"I understand well enough, sir,\" answered he sulkily, \"that this is merely a prologue to a romantic drama.\"  \"You are right, my lad,\" cried he, in a more satisfied voice; \"and it is one that is quite indispensable. The plot of the drama will be revealed to you later on, and also the reward you will receive if you play your part well.\"  \"But why cannot you tell me everything now?\"  Tantaine shook his head.  \"Have patience, you rash boy!\" said he. \"Rome was not built in a day. Be guided by me, and follow blindly the orders of those interested in you. This is your first lesson; think it over seriously.\"  \"My first lesson! What do you mean?\"  \"Call it a rehearsal if you like. All that the good woman told you,\" continued Tantaine, \"you must look upon as true; nay, it is true, and when you believe this thoroughly, you are quite prepared for the fray, but until then you must remain quiescent. Remember this, you cannot impress others unless you firmly believe yourself. The greatest impostors of all ages have ever been their own dupes.\"  At the word impostor, Paul seemed about to speak, but a wave of Tantaine's hand silenced him.  \"You must cast aside your old skin, and enter that of another. Paul Violaine, the natural son of a woman who kept a small drapery shop at Poitiers, Paul Violaine, the youthful lover of Rose, no longer exists. He died of cold and hunger in a garret in the Hotel de Perou, as M. de Loupins will testify when necessary.\"  The tone in which Tantaine spoke showed his intense earnestness, and with emphatic gestures he drove each successive idea into Paul's brain.  \"You will rid yourself of your former recollections as you do of an old coat, which you throw aside, and forget the very existence of. And not only that, but you must lose your memory, and that so entirely, that if any one in the street calls out Violaine, you will never even dream of turning round.\"  Paul's brain seemed to tremble beneath the crime that his companion was teaching him.  \"Who am I then?\" asked he.  A sardonic smile crossed Tantaine's face.  \"You are just what the portress told you, Paul, and nothing more. Your first recollections are of a Foundling Hospital, and you never knew your parents. You have lived here fifteen months, and before that you resided in the Rue Jacob. The portress knows no more; but if you will come with me to the Rue Jacob, the people there can tell you more about your life when you were a lodger in the house. Perhaps, if you are careful, we may take you back to your more childish days, and even find you a father.\"  \"But,\" said Paul, \"I might be questioned regarding my past life: what then? M. Rigal or Mademoiselle Flavia might interrogate me at any moment?\"  \"I see; but do not disquiet yourself. You will be furnished with all necessary papers, so that you can account for all your life during the twenty-five years you spent in this world.\"  \"Then I presume that the person into whose shoes I have crept was a composer and a musician like myself?\"  Again Tantaine's patience gave way, and it was with an oath that he exclaimed,--  \"Are you acting the part of a fool, or are you one in reality? No one has ever been here except you. Did you not hear what the old woman said? She told you that you are a musician, a self-made one, and while waiting until your talents are appreciated, you give lessons in music.\"  \"And to whom do I _give_ them?\"  Tantaine took three visiting cards from a china ornament on the mantelshelf.  \"Here are three pupils of yours,\" said he, \"who can pay you one hundred francs per month for two lessons a week, and two of them will assure you that you have taught them for some time. The third, Madame Grandorge, a widow, will vow that she owes all her success, which is very great, to your lessons. You will go and give these pupils their lessons at the hours noted on their cards, and you will be received as if you had often been to the house before; and remember to be perfectly at your ease.\"  \"I will do my best to follow your instructions.\"  \"One last piece of information. In addition to your lessons, you are in the habit of copying for certain wealthy amateurs the fragments of old and almost obsolete operas, and on the piano lies the work that you are engaged on for the Marquis de Croisenois, a charming composition by Valserra. You see,\" continued Tantaine, taking Paul by the arm, and showing him round the room, \"that nothing has been forgotten, and that you have lived here for years past. You have always been a steady young man, and have saved up a little money. In this drawer you will find eight certificates of scrip from the Bank of France.\"  Paul would have put many more questions, but the visitor was already on the threshold, and only paused to add these words,--  \"I will call here to-morrow with Dr. Hortebise.\" Then, with a strange smile playing on his lips, he added, as Mascarin had before, \"You will be a duke yet.\"  The old portress was waiting for Tantaine, and as soon as she saw him coming down the stairs immersed in deep thought, out she ran toward him with as much alacrity as her corpulency would admit.  \"Did I do it all right?\" asked she.  \"Hush!\" answered he, pushing her quickly into her lodge, the door of which stood open. \"Hush! are you mad or drunk, to talk like this, when you do not know who is listening?\"  \"I hope you were pleased with my success,\" continued the woman, aghast at his sudden anger.  \"You did well--very well; you piled up the evidence perfectly. I shall have an excellent report to make of you to M. Mascarin.\"  \"I am so glad; and now my husband and I are quite safe?\"  The old man shook his head with an air of doubt.  \"Well, I can hardly say that yet; the master's arm is long and strong; but you have numerous enemies. All the servants in the house hate you, and would be glad to see you come to grief.\"  \"Is that really so, sir? How can that be, for both I and my husband have been very kind to all of them?\"  \"Yes, perhaps you have been lately, but how about the times before? You and your husband both acted very foolishly. Article 386 cannot be got now, and two women can swear that they saw you and your husband, with a bunch of keys in your hand, on the second floor.\"  The fat woman's face turned a sickly yellow, she clasped her hands, and whined in tones of piteous entreaty,--  \"Don't speak so loud, sir, I beg of you.\"  \"You made a terrible mistake in not coming to my master earlier, for there had been then so much talk that the matter had reached the ears of the police.\"  \"But for all that, if M. Mascarin pleased----\"  \"He does please, my good woman, and is quite willing to serve you. I am sure that he will manage to break the inquiry; or if it must go on, he has several witnesses who will depose in your favor; but, you know, he gives nothing for nothing, and must have implicit obedience.\"  \"Good, kind man that he is, my husband and I would go through fire and water for him, while my daughter, Euphenice, would do anything in the world for him.\"  Tantaine recoiled uneasily, for the old woman's gratitude was so demonstrative that he feared she was about to embrace him.  \"All you have to do is to stick firmly to what you have said about Paul,\" continued he, when he found himself at a safe distance; \"and if ever you breathe a word of what you have been doing, he will hand you over to the law, and then take care of Article 386.\"  It was evident that this portion of the Code, that had reference to the robbery of masters by servants, struck terror into the woman's soul.  \"If I stood on the scaffold,\" said she, \"I would tell the story about M. Paul exactly as I have been taught.\"  Her tone was so sincere, that Tantaine addressed her in a kindlier voice.  \"Stick to that,\" said he, \"and I can say to you, 'Hope.' Upon the day on which the young man's business is settled you will get a paper from me, which will prove your complete innocence, and enable you to say, 'I have been grossly maligned.'\"  \"May the dear young man's business be settled sharp,\" said she.  \"It will not be long before it is so; but, remember, in the meantime you must keep an eye upon him.\"  \"I will do so.\"  \"And, remember, report to me whoever comes to see him, no matter who it may be.\"  \"Not a soul can go upstairs without my seeing or hearing him.\"  \"Well, if any one, save the master, Dr. Hortebise, or myself comes, do not lose a moment, but come and report.\"  \"You shall know in five minutes.\"  \"I wonder if that is all I have to say?\" mused Tantaine. \"Ah! I remember: note exactly the hour at which this young man comes and goes. Do not have any conversation with him; answer all questions he addresses you with a simple 'Yes,' or 'No,' and, as I said before, watch his every movement.\"  And Tantaine turned to go away, paying no attention to the woman's eager protestations.  \"Keep a strict watch,\" were his last words, \"and, above all, see that the lad gets into no scrape.\"  In Tantaine's presence Paul had endeavored to assume an air of bravado, but as soon as he was left alone he was seized with such mortal terror, that he sank in a half fainting condition into an easy-chair. He felt that he was not going to put on a disguise for a brief period, but for life, and that now, though he rose in life, wealth, title, even a wife would all have been obtained by a shameful and skilfully planned deception, and this deception he must keep up until the day of his death. He shuddered as he recalled Tantaine's words, \"Paul Violaine is dead.\" He recalled the incidents in the life of the escaped galley-slave Coignard, who, under the name of Pontis de St. Helene, absolutely assumed the rank of a general officer, and took command of a domain. Coignard was recognized and betrayed by an old fellow-prisoner, and this was exactly the risk that Paul knew he must run, for any of his old companions might recognize and denounce him. Had he on such an occasion sufficient presence of mind to turn laughingly to his accuser, and say, \"Really, my good fellow, you are in error, for I never set eyes on you before?\"  He felt that he could not do it, and had he any means of existence, he would have solved the difficulty by taking to flight. But he knew that men like Mascarin, Hortebise, and Tantaine were not easily eluded, and his heart sank within him as he remembered the various crumbs of information that each of these men had dropped before him. To agree to their sordid proposals, and to remain in the position in which he was, was certainly to incur a risk, but it was one that was a long way off, and might never eventually come to pass; while to change his mind would be as sure to bring down swift and condign punishment upon his head; and the weak young man naturally chose the more remote contingency, and with this determination the last qualms of his conscience expired.  The first night he slept badly in his new abode, for it seemed to him as if the spectre of the man whose place he was to usurp was hovering over his couch. But with the dawn of day, and especially when the hour arrived for him to go out and give his lessons, he felt his courage return to him, though rashness perhaps would be the more correct word. And with a mien of perfect confidence he repaired to the house of Mademoiselle Grandorge, the oldest of his pupils. Impelled by the same feeling of curiosity as to how Paul would comport himself, both Dr. Hortebise and Father Tantaine had been hanging about the Rue Montmartre, and taking advantage of a heavy dray that was passing, caught a good glimpse of the young man.  \"Aha,\" chuckled Tantaine, delighted at seeing Paul look so brisk and joyous, \"our young cock is in full feather; last night he was decidedly rather nervous.\"  \"Yes,\" answered the doctor, \"he is on the right road, and I think that we shall have no further trouble with him.\"  They then thought it would be as well to see Mother Brigaut, and were received by the old woman with slavish deference.  \"No one has been near the dear young gentleman,\" said she, in reply to their questions. \"Last night he came down about seven o'clock, and asked where the nearest eating-house was. I directed him to Du Val's, and he was back by eight, and by eleven I saw that he had put out his light.\"  \"How about to-day?\"  \"I went up stairs at nine, and he had just finished dressing. He told me to get his breakfast ready, which I did. He ate well, and I said to myself, 'Good; the bird is getting used to its cage.'\"  \"And then?\"  \"Then he commenced singing like a very bird, the dear fellow. His voice is as sweet as his face; any woman would fall in love with him. I'm precious glad that my girl, Euphenice is nowhere near.\"  \"And after that he went out?\" continued Tantaine. \"Did he say how long he would be away?\"  \"Only to give his lessons. I suppose he expected that you would call.\"  \"Very good,\" remarked the old man; then, addressing Dr. Hortebise, he said, \"Perhaps, sir, you are going to the Registry Office?\"  \"Yes; I want to see Mascarin.\"  \"He is not there; but if you want to see him on any special matter, you had better come to our young friend's apartment, and await his arrival.\"  \"Very well, I will do so,\" answered the doctor.  Hortebise was much more impressed than Paul with the skill of the hand which had imparted such a look of long occupation to the rooms.  \"On my word, the quiet simplicity of these rooms would induce any father to give his daughter to this young fellow.\"  The old man's silence surprised him, and turning sharply round, he was struck by the gloomy look upon his features.  \"What is the matter?\" asked Hortebise, with some anxiety. \"What is troubling you?\"  Tantaine had thrown himself into a chair, and for a moment made no reply; then, springing to his feet, he gave the expiring embers a furious kick, and faced the doctor with folded arms.  \"I see much trouble before us,\" said he at last.  The doctor's face grew as gloomy as that of his companion.  \"Is it Perpignan who interferes?\" asked he.  \"No, Perpignan is only a fool; but he will do what I tell him.\"  \"Then I really do not see--\"  \"Do not see,\" exclaimed Tantaine; \"but luckily for us all, I am not so blind. Have you forgotten this marriage of De Croisenois? There lies the danger. All had gone so smoothly, every combination had been arranged, and every difficulty foreseen, and now----\"  \"Well, you had made too sure, that was all; and you were unprepared for the slightest check.\"  \"Not so, but I had made no attempt to guard against the impossible.\"  \"Of course, there are limits to all human intelligence, but pray explain yourself.\"  \"This is it, then, doctor. The most adroit energy could never have put in our way such an obstacle as now threatens us. Have you in your experience of society ever come across a wealthy heiress who is indifferent to all the allurements of luxury, and is capable of disinterested love?\"  The doctor smiled an expressive denial.  \"But such an heiress does exist,\" said Tantaine, \"and her name is Sabine de Mussidan. She loves--and whom do you think?--why a mere painter, who has crossed my path three times already. He is full, too, of energy and perseverance, and for these qualities I have never met his equal.\"  \"What, a man without friends, money, or position, what can--\"  A rapid gesture of Tantaine's checked his companion's speech.  \"Unfortunately he is not without friends,\" remarked the genial Tantaine. \"He has one friend at least; can you guess who it is? No less a personage than the man who was to have married Sabine, M. de Breulh-Faverlay.\"  At this unexpected news Hortebise remained silent and aghast.  \"How on earth those two met I cannot imagine. It must have been Sabine that brought them together, but the facts remain the same. They are close friends anyhow. And these two men have in their interests the very woman that I had selected to push De Croisenois' suit.\"  \"Is it possible?\"  \"That is my present belief. At any rate, these three had a long interview last night, and doubtless came to a decision hostile to the interests of the Marquis.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked Hortebise, his lips tightly compressed with anxiety. \"Do you mean that they are aware of the manner by which De Croisenois hopes to succeed?\"  \"Look here?\" answered Tantaine. \"A general, on the eve of a battle, takes every precaution, but among his subordinates there are always fools, if not traitors. I had arranged a pretty little scene between Croisenois and Van Klopen, by which the Viscountess would be securely trapped. Unfortunately, though the rehearsal was excellent, the representation was simply idiotic. Neither of the actors took the least trouble to enter into the spirit of his part. I had arranged a scene full of delicacy and _finesse_, and they simply made a low, coarse exhibition of it and themselves. Fools! they thought it was the easiest thing in the world to deceive a woman; and finally the Marquis, to whom I had recommended the most perfect discretion, opened fire, and actually spoke of Sabine and his desire to press his suit. The Viscountess found, with a woman's keen perceptions, that there was something arranged between Van Klopen and her visitor, and hurried off to her cousin, M. de Breulh-Faverlay for advice and assistance.\"  The doctor listened to this recital, pallid and trembling.  \"Who told you all this?\" gasped he.  \"No one; I discovered it; and it was easy to do so. When we have a result, it is easy to trace it back to the cause. Yes, this is what took place.\"  \"Why don't you say at once that the whole scheme is knocked on the head?\" asked the doctor.  \"Because I do not think that it is; I know that we have sustained a very severe check; but when you are playing _ecarte_ and your adversary has made five points to your one, you do not necessarily throw down the cards and give up the game? Not a bit; you hold on and strive to better your luck.\"  The worthy Dr. Hortebise did not know whether the most to admire the perseverance or deplore the obstinacy of the old man, and exclaimed,--  \"Why, this is utter madness; it is like plunging headlong into a deep pit, which you can easily see in your path.\"  Tantaine gave a long, low whistle.  \"My friend,\" said he, \"what in your opinion would be the best course to pursue?\"  \"I should say, without a moment's hesitation, turn up the whole scheme, and look out for another one, which, if less lucrative, would not be so full of danger. You had hoped to win the game, and with good reason too. Now throw aside all feelings of wounded vanity, and accept your defeat. After all, it does not matter to us who Mademoiselle de Mussidan marries. The great enterprise fortunately does not lie in this alliance. We have still the idea of the Company to which all old people must subscribe remaining to us, and we can work it up at once.\"  He stopped short, abashed by the look on Tantaine's face.  \"It strikes me,\" resumed the doctor, a little mortified, \"that my proposal is not utterly ridiculous, and certainly deserves some consideration.\"  \"Perhaps so; but is it a practical one?\"  \"I see no reason why it should not be.\"  \"Indeed, then, you look at the thing in a very different manner to myself. We are too far advanced, my dear doctor, to be our own masters. We must go on, and have no option to do otherwise. To beat a retreat would simply be to invite our enemies to fall upon our disorganized battalions. We must give battle; and as the first to strike has always the best chance of victory, we must strive to take the initiative.\"  \"The idea is good, but these are mere words.\"  \"Was the secret that we confided to De Croisenois only words?\"  This thrust went home.  \"Do you mean that you think he would betray us?\" said he.  \"Why should he not if it were to his interests to do so? Reflect, Croisenois is almost at the end of his tether. We have dangled the line of a princely fortune before his eyes. Do you think he would do nothing if we were to say, 'Excuse us, but we made a mistake; poor as you are, so you must remain, for we do not intend to help you?'\"  \"But is it necessary to say that at all?\"  \"Well, at any rate, whatever we choose to say, what limit do you think he will place upon his extortions now that he holds our secret? We have taught him his music, and he will make us do our part in the chorus, and can blackmail us as well as we can others.\"  \"We played a foolish game,\" answered Dr. Hortebise moodily.  \"No; we had to confide in some one. Besides, the two affairs, that of Madame de Mussidan and the Duke de Champdoce, ran so well together. They were the simultaneous emanations of my brain. I worked them up together, and together they must stand or fall.\"  \"Then you are determined to go on?\"  \"Yes; more determined than ever.\"  The doctor had been playing with his locket for some time, and the contact of the cold metal seemed to have affected his nerves; for it was in a trembling voice that he replied,--  \"I vowed long ago that we should sink or swim together.\" He paused, and then, with a melancholy smile upon his face, continued,--\"I have no intention of breaking my oath, you see; but I repeat, that your road seems to be a most perilous one, and I will add that I consider you headstrong and self-opinionated; but for all that I will follow you, even though the path you have chosen leads to the grave. I have at this moment a something between my fingers that will save me from shame and disgrace--a little pill to be swallowed, a gasp, a little dizziness, and all is over.\"  Tantaine did not seem to care for the doctor's explanation.  \"There, that will do,\" said he. \"If things come to the worst, you can use the contents of your locket as much as you like, but in the meantime leave it alone, and do not keep jingling it in that distracting manner. For people of our stamp a danger well known is a comparatively slight peril, for threats furnish us with means of defence. Woe, I say, woe to the man who crosses my path, for I will hold my hand from nothing!\" He stopped for a little, opened every door, and assured himself that there were no eavesdroppers, and then, in a low whisper, he said to Hortebise, \"Do you not see that there is but one obstacle to our success, and that is Andre? Remove him, and the whole of our machinery will work as smoothly as ever.\"  Hortebise winced, as if suffering from a sudden pain.  \"Do you mean----?\" asked he.  But Tantaine interrupted him with a low laugh, terrible to listen to.  \"And why not?\" said he. \"Is it not better to kill than to be killed?\"  Hortebise trembled from head to foot. He had no objection to extorting money by the basest threats, but he drew the line at murder.  \"And suppose we were found out?\" muttered he.  \"Nonsense! How could we be discovered? Justice always looks for a motive; how, then could they bring it home to us? They could only find out that a young lady adored by De Breulh had thrown him over in order to marry Andre.\"  \"Horrible!\" murmured the doctor, much shocked.  \"I daresay that it is horrible, and I have no wish to proceed to extremities. I only wish to speak of it as a remote possibility, and one that we may be compelled to adopt. I hate violence just as much as you do, and trust that it may not be necessary.\"  Just then the door opened, and Paul entered, a letter in his hand. He seemed in excellent spirits, and shook hands with both his visitors.  Tantaine smiled sarcastically as he contrasted Paul's high spirits with the state of depression in which he had left him not many hours ago.  \"Things are evidently going well with you,\" remarked the doctor, forcing a smile.  \"Yes; I cannot find any reason for complaint.\"  \"Have you given your lesson?\"  \"Yes; what a delightful woman Madame Grandorge is! she has treated me so kindly.\"  \"That is a good reason for your being so happy,\" remarked the doctor, with a tinge of irony in his voice.  \"Ah, that is not the only reason,\" returned Paul.  \"Shall I be indiscreet if I ask the real cause, then?\"  \"I am not quite sure whether I ought to speak on this matter,\" said he fatuously.  \"What! a love adventure already?\" laughed the doctor.  The vanity of Paul's nature beamed out in a smile.  \"Keep your secret, my boy,\" said Tantaine, in louder accents.  This, of course, was enough to loosen Paul's tongue.  \"Do you think, sir,\" said he, \"that I would keep anything from you?\" He opened the letter he held in his hand, continuing: \"The portress handed this to me as I came in; she said it was left by a bank messenger. Can you guess where it came from? Let me tell you--it is from Mademoiselle Flavia Rigal, and leaves no room to doubt of her sentiments toward me.\"  \"Is that a fact?\"  \"It is so; and whenever I choose, Mademoiselle Flavia will be only too ready to become Madame Paul.\"  For an instant a bright flush crimsoned old Tantaine's wrinkled face, but it faded away almost as soon as it appeared.  \"Then you feel happy?\" asked he, with a slight quiver in his voice.  Paul threw back his coat, and, placing his fingers in the armholes of his waistcoat, remarked carelessly,--  \"Yes, of course, I am happy, as you may suppose; but the news is not particularly startling to me. On my third visit to M. Rigal's, the girl let me know that I need not sigh in vain.\"  Tantaine covered his face with his hands as Paul passed his fingers through his hair, and, striking what he considered an imposing attitude, read as follows:--  \"MY DEAR PAUL,--  \"I was very naughty, and I repent of it. I could not sleep all night, for I was haunted by the look of sorrow I saw in your face when you took leave of me. Paul, I did it to try you. Can you forgive me? You might, for I suffered much more than you could have done. Some one who loves me--perhaps more than you do--has told me that when a girl shows all the depths of her heart to a man she runs the risk of his despising her. Can this be true? I hope not, Paul, for never--no, never--can I conceal my feelings; and the proof of my faith in you is that I am going now to tell you all. I am sure that if your good friend and mine, Dr. Hortebise, came to my father with a certain request from you, it would not be rejected.  \"Your own  \"FLAVIA.\"   \"Did not this letter go straight to your heart?\" asked Tantaine.  \"Of course it did. Why, she will have a million for her wedding portion!\"  On hearing these words, Tantaine started up with so threatening an aspect that Paul recoiled a step, but a warning look from the doctor restrained the old man's indignation.  \"He is a perfect sham!\" muttered he; \"even his vices are mere pretence.\"  \"He is our pupil, and is what we have made him,\" whispered Tantaine.  Meanwhile Tantaine had gone up to Paul, and, placing his hand caressingly on his shoulder, said,--  \"My boy, you will never know how much you owe to Mademoiselle Flavia.\"  Paul could not understand the meaning of this scene. These men had done their best to pervert his morals, and to deaden the voice of his conscience, and now that he had hoped to earn their praise by an affectation of cynicism they were displeased with him. Before, however, he could ask a question, Tantaine had completely recovered his self-command.  \"My dear boy,\" said he, \"I am quite satisfied with you. I came here to-day expecting to find you still undecided, and I am pleased with the change.\"  \"But, sir--\" said Paul.  \"On the contrary, you are firm and strong.\"  \"Yes, he has got on so well,\" said the doctor, \"that we should now treat him as one of ourselves, and confide more in him. To-night, my young friend, M. Mascarin will get from Caroline Schimmel the solution of the riddle that has for so long perplexed us. Be at the office to-morrow at ten o'clock, and you shall be told everything.\"  Paul would have asked more questions, but Tantaine cut him short with a brief good-morning, and went off hurriedly, taking the doctor with him, and seemingly wishing to avoid a hazardous and unpleasant explanation.  \"Let us get out of this,\" whispered he. \"In another moment I should have knocked the conceited ass down. Oh, my Flavia! my poor Flavia! your weakness of to-day will yet cost you very dear!\"  Paul remained rooted to the ground, with an expression of surprise and confusion upon every line of his face. All his pride and vanity had gone. \"I wonder,\" muttered he, \"what these disagreeable persons are saying about me? Perhaps laughing at my inexperience and ridiculing my aspirations.\" The idea made him grind his teeth with rage; but he was mistaken, for neither Tantaine nor the doctor mentioned his name after they had left his apartment. As they walked up the Rue Montmartre, all their ideas were turning upon how it would be easiest to checkmate Andre.  \"I have not yet got sufficient information to act on,\" remarked Tantaine meditatively. \"My present plan is to remain perfectly quiescent, and I have told Croisenois not to make a move of any kind. I have an eye and ear watching and listening when they think themselves in perfect privacy. Very soon I shall fathom their plans, and then--, but in the meantime have faith in me, and do not let the matter worry you.\"  On the boulevard Tantaine took leave of his friend.  \"I shall very likely not see you to-night, for I have an appointment at the Grand Turk with that precious young rascal, Toto Chupin. I _must_ find Caroline, for I am sure that with her lies the Champdoce secret. She is very cunning, but has a weakness for drink, and, with Satan's help, I hope to find out the special liquor which will make her open her lips freely.\"    CHAPTER XXVI.  AT THE GRAND TURK.  Tantaine took a cab, and, promising the cabman a handsome gratuity if he would drive fast, stopped at the spot where the Rue Blanche intersects the Rue de Douai, and told the coachman to wait for him, and entered the house where the younger Gandelu had installed the fair Madame de Chantemille. It was some time before his ring at the door was answered, but at last the door was opened by a stout, red-faced girl, with an untidy cap. Upon seeing Tantaine, she uttered an exclamation of delight, for it was the cook that had been placed in Zora's employment by M. Mascarin's agency.  \"Ah, Daddy Tantaine,\" said she, \"you are as welcome as the sun in winter.\"  \"Hush, hush,\" returned the old man, gazing cautiously round him.  \"Don't be frightened,\" returned the girl. \"Madame has gone to a place from whence there is no return ticket, at least, for some time. You know the greater the value of an article the closer we keep it under lock and key.\"  Tantaine gathered from this that Rose had been arrested, and his astonishment appeared to be unmeasured.  \"Surely you don't mean that she has gone to quod?\" said he.  \"It is as I tell you,\" answered she; \"but come in, and have a glass of wine, while you hear all about it.\"  She led the old man into the dining-room, round the table in which a half dozen guests were seated, just concluding a late breakfast. Tantaine at once recognized four of the several guests as servants whom he knew from their having applied for situations at the office, and there were two men of a very unprepossessing exterior.  \"We are having a regular spree to-day,\" observed the cook, handing a bottle to Tantaine; \"but yesterday there was not much of a jollification here, for just as I was setting about getting the dinner two fellows came in and asked for my mistress, and as soon as they saw her they clapped their hands on her and said that she must come to the stone jug. When madame heard this she shrieked so loud as to have been heard in the next street. She would not go a foot with them, clung to the furniture and banisters, so they just took her up by the head and feet, and carried her down to a cab that was standing at the door. I seem to bring ill luck wherever I go, for this is the fourth mistress I have seen taken off in this way; but come, you are taking nothing at all.\"  But Tantaine had had enough, and making an excuse, retired from a debauch which he saw would continue as long as the wine held out.  \"All is going well,\" muttered he, as he climbed into the cab; \"and now for the next one.\"  He drove straight to the house that the elder Gandelu was building in the Champs Elysees, and putting his head out of the window, he accosted a light, active young fellow who was warning the foot passengers not to pass under the scaffolding.  \"Anything new, La Cordille?\" enquired the old man.  \"No, nothing; but tell the master I am keeping a good watch.\"  From there Tantaine visited a footman in De Breulh's employment, and a woman in the service of Madame de Bois Arden. Then, paying his fare, he started on foot for Father Canon's wine shop, in the Rue St. Honore, where he met Florestan, who was as saucy and supercilious to Tantaine as he was obsequious to Mascarin. But although he paid for Florestan's dinner, all that he could extort from him was, that Sabine was terribly depressed. It was fully eight o'clock before Tantaine had got rid of Florestan, and hailing another cab, he ordered the driver to take him to the Grand Turk, in the Rue des Poissonniers.  The magnificent sign of the Grand Turk dances in the breeze, and invites such youths as Toto Chupin and his companions. The whole aspect of the exterior seemed to invite the passers-by to step in and try the good cheer provided within,--a good _table d'hote_ at six p.m., coffee, tea, liquors, and a grand ball to complete the work of digestion. A long corridor leads to this earthly Eden, and the two doors at the end of it open, the one into the dining, and the other into the ball-room. A motley crew collected there for the evening meal, and on Sundays it is next to impossible to procure a seat. But the dining-room is the Grand Turk's greatest attraction, for as soon as the dessert is over the head waiter makes a sign, and dishes and tablecloths are cleared away in a moment. The dining-room becomes a _café_, and the click of dominoes gives way to the rattle of forks, while beer flows freely. This, however, is nothing, for, at a second signal, huge folding doors are thrown open, and the strains of an orchestra ring out as an invitation to the ball, to which all diners are allowed free entrance. Nothing is danced but round dances, polkas, mazurkas, and waltzes.  The German element was very strong at the Grand Turk, and if a gentleman wished to make himself agreeable to his fair partners, it was necessary for him, at any rate, to be well up in the Alsatian dialect. The master of the ceremonies had already called upon the votaries of Terpsichore to take their places for the waltz as Daddy Tantaine entered the hall. The scene was a most animated one, and the air heavy with the scent of beer and tobacco, and would have asphyxiated any one not used to venture into such places.  It was the first time that he had ever visited the Grand Turk, and yet any one observing would have sworn that he was one of the regular frequenters as he marched idly through the rooms, making constant pauses at the bar. But glance around him as he might, he could see neither Toto Chupin nor Caroline Schimmel.  \"Have I come here for nothing,\" muttered he, \"or is the hour too early?\"  It was hard to waste time thus, but at last he sat down and ordered some beer. His eyes wandered to a large picture on the wall, representing a fat, eastern-looking man, with a white turban and loose, blue garments, seated in a crimson chair, with his feet resting upon a yellow carpet. One hand was caressing his protuberant paunch, while the other was extended toward a glass of beer. Evidently this is the Grand Turk. And finally by an odalisque, who fills his goblet with the foaming infusion of malt and hops. This odalisque is very fair and stout, and some fair Alsatian damsel has evidently sat as the model. As Tantaine was gazing upon this wondrous work of art he heard a squeaking voice just behind him.  \"That is certainly that young rogue Chupin,\" muttered he.  He turned sharply round, and two tables off, in a dark corner, he discovered the young gentleman that he had been looking for. As he gazed on the lad, he was not surprised that he had not recognized him at first, for Toto had been strangely transmogrified, and in no degree resembled the boy who had shivered in a tattered blouse in the archway near the Servants' Registry Office. He was now gorgeous to behold. From the moment that he had got his hundred francs he had chalked out a new line of life for himself, and was busy pursuing it. He had found that he could make all his friends merry, and he had succeeded. He had made a selection from the most astounding wares that the Parisian tailor keeps on hand. He had sneered at young Gaston de Gandelu, and called him an ape; but he had aped the ape. He wore a very short, light coat, a waistcoat that was hideous from its cut and brilliancy, and trousers strapped tightly under his feet. His collar was so tall and stiff, that he had the greatest difficulty in turning his head. He had gone to a barber, and his lank hair had been artistically curled. The table in front of him was covered with glasses and bottles. Two shocking looking scamps of the true barrier bully type, with loose cravats and shiny-peaked caps, were seated by him, and were evidently his guests. Tantaine's first impulse was to catch the debauched youth by the ear, but he hesitated for an instant and reflection conquered the impulse. With the utmost caution so that he might not attract Toto's attention, he crept down to him, concealing himself as best he could behind one of the pillars that supported the gallery, and by this manoeuvre found himself so close to the lad that he could catch every word he said.  Chupin was talking volubly.  \"Don't you call me a swell, nor yet say that I brag,\" said he. \"I shall always make this kind of appearance, for to work in the manner I propose, a man must pay some attention to dress.\"  At this his companions roared with laughter.  \"All right,\" returned Toto. \"I'm precious sharp, though you may not think so, and shall go in for all kinds of elegant accomplishments, and come out a regular masher.\"  \"Wonders will never cease,\" answered one of the men. \"When you go on your trip for action in the Bois among the toffs, will you take me with you?\"  \"Any one can go to the Bois who has money: and just tell me who are those who make money. Why, those who have plenty of cheek and a good sound business. Well, I have learned my business from some real downy cards, who made it pay well. Why should I not do the same?\"  With a sickening feeling of terror, Tantaine saw that the lad was half drunk. What could he be going to say? and how much did he know? Toto's guests evidently saw that he had taken too much; but as he seemed ready to let them into a secret, they paid great attention, and exchanged a look of intelligence. The young rogue's new clothes and his liberality all proved that he had found a means of gaining money; the only question was what the plan could be. To induce him to talk they passed the bottle rapidly and flattered him up. The younger man of the two shook his head with a smile.  \"I don't believe you have any business at all,\" said he.  \"Nor have I, if by business you mean some low handicraft. It is brain work I mean, my boy; and that's what I do.\"  \"I don't doubt that a bit,\" answered the elder guest coaxingly.  \"Come on! Tell us what it is,\" broke in the other. \"You don't expect us to take your word.\"  \"It is as easy as lying,\" replied Toto. \"Listen a bit, and you shall have the whole bag of tricks. Suppose I saw Polyte steal a couple of pairs of boots from a trotter-case seller's stall----\"  Polyte interrupted the narrator, protesting so strongly that he would not commit such an act, that Tantaine perceived at once that some such trifling act of larceny weighed heavily on his conscience.  \"You needn't kick up such a row,\" returned Toto. \"I am only just putting it as a thing that might happen. We will say you had done the trick, and that I had twigged you. Do you know what I should go? Well, I would hunt up Polyte, and say quietly, 'Halves, old man, or I will split.'\"  \"And I should give you a crack in the jaw,\" returned Polyte angrily.  Forgetting his fine dress, Toto playfully put his thumb to his nose and extended his fingers.  \"You would not be such an ass,\" said he. \"You would say to yourself, 'If I punch this chap, he will kick up no end of a row, and I shall be taken up, and perhaps sent to the mill.' No; you would be beastly civil, and would end by doing just as I wished.\"  \"And this is what you call your business, is it?\"  \"Isn't it a good one--the mugs stand the racket, and the downy cards profit by it?\"  \"But there is no novelty in this; it is only blackmail after all.\"  \"I never said it wasn't; but it is blackmailing perfected into a system.\"  As Toto made this reply he hammered on the table, calling for more drink.  \"But,\" remarked Polyte, with an air of disappointment, \"you don't get chances every day, and the business is often a precious poor one. You can't always be seeing chaps prigging boots.\"  \"Pooh! pooh!\" answered Toto, \"if you want to make money in this business, you must keep your eyes about you. Our customers don't come to you, but there is nothing to prevent you going to them. You can hunt until you find them.\"  \"And where are you to hunt, if you please?\"  \"Ah, that's tellings.\"  A long silence ensued, during which Tantaine was half tempted to come forward. By doing so he would assuredly nip all explanations in the bud; but, on the other hand, he wanted to hear all the young rascal had to say. He therefore only moved a little nearer, and listened more intently.  Forgetting his curls, Toto was abstractedly passing his fingers through his hair, and reflecting with all the wisdom of a muddled brain. Finally, he came to the conclusion that he might speak, and, leaning forward, he whispered,--  \"You won't peach if I tell you the dodge?\"  His companions assured him that he might have every confidence in them.  \"Very well; I make my money in the Champs Elysees, and sometimes get a harvest twice a day.\"  \"But there are no shoemakers' shops there.\"  \"You are a fool,\" answered Toto contemptuously. \"Do you think I blackmail thieves? That wouldn't be half good enough. Honest people, or at least people who call themselves honest, are my game. These are the ones who can be made to pay up.\"  Tantaine shuddered; he remembered that Mascarin had made use of the same expression, and at once surmised that Toto must have had an occasional ear to the keyhole.  \"But,\" objected Polyte, \"honest people have no occasion to pay up.\"  Toto struck his glass so heavily on the table that it flew to shivers.  \"Will you let me speak?\" said he.  \"Go on, go on, my boy,\" returned his friend.  \"Well, when I'm hard up for cash, I go into the Champs Elysees, and take a seat on one of the benches. From there I keep an eye on the cabs and see who gets out of them. If a respectable woman does so, I am sure of my bird.\"  \"Do you think you know a respectable woman when you see her?\"  \"I should think that I did. Well, when a respectable woman gets out of a cab where she ought not to have been, she looks about her on all sides, first to the right and then to the left, settles her veil, and, as soon as she is sure that no one is watching her, sets off as if old Nick was behind her.\"  \"Well, what do you do then?\"  \"Why, I take the number of the cab, and follow the lady home. Then I wait until she has had time to get to her own rooms, and go to the porter and say, 'Will you give me the name of the lady who has just come in?'\"  \"And do you think the porter is fool enough to do so?\"  \"Not a bit; I always take the precaution of having a delicate little purse in my pocket; and when the man says, as he always does, 'I don't know,' I pull out the purse, and say, 'I am sorry for that, for she dropped this as she came in, and I wanted to return it to her.' The porter at once becomes awfully civil; he gives the name and number, and up I go. The first time I content myself with finding out if she is married or single. If she is single, it is no go; but if the reverse, I go on with the job.\"  \"Why, what do you do next?\"  \"Next morning I go there, and hang about until I see the husband go out. Then I go upstairs, and ask for the wife. It is ticklish work then, my lads; but I say, 'Yesterday, madame, I was unlucky enough to leave my pocketbook in cab number so-and-so. Now, as I saw you hail the vehicle immediately after I had left it, I have come to ask you if you saw my pocketbook.' The lady flies into a rage, denies all knowledge of the book, and threatens to have me turned out. Then, with the utmost politeness, I say, 'I see, madame, that there is nothing to be done but to communicate the matter to your husband.' Then she gets alarmed, and--she pays.\"  \"And you don't see any more of her?\"  \"Not that day; but when the funds are low, I call and say, 'It is I again, madame; I am the poor young man who lost his money in such and such a cab on a certain day of the month.' And so the game goes on. A dozen such clients give a fellow a very fair income. Now, perhaps, you understand why I am always so well dressed, and always have money in my pocket. When I was shabbily attired, they offered me a five-franc piece, but now they come down with a flimsy.\"  The young wretch spoke the truth; for to many women, who in a mad moment of passion may have forgotten themselves, and been tracked to their homes by some prowling blackmailer, life has been an endless journey of agony. Every knock at the door makes them start, and every footfall on the staircase causes a tremor as they think that the villain has come to betray their guilty secret.  \"That is all talk,\" said Polyte; \"such things are never done.\"  \"They _are_ done,\" returned Toto sulkily.  \"Have you ever tried the dodge yourself, then?\" sneered Polyte.  At another time Chupin would have lied, but the fumes of the drink he had taken, added to his natural self-conceit, had deprived him of all judgment.  \"Well,\" muttered he, \"if I have not done it myself exactly, I have seen others practise it often enough--on a much larger scale, it is true; but one can always do things in a more miniature fashion with perhaps a better chance of success.\"  \"What! _you_ have seen this done?\"  \"Of course I have.\"  \"And had you a share in the swag?\"  \"To a certain extent. I have followed the cabs times without number, and have watched the goings on of these fine ladies and gentlemen; only I was working for others, like the dog that catches the hare, and never has a bit of it to eat. No, all I got was dry bread, with a kick or a cuff for dessert. I sha'n't put up with it any longer, and have made up my mind to open on my own account.\"  \"And who has been employing you?\"  A flash of sense passed through Chupin's muddled brain. He had never wished to injure Mascarin, but merely to increase his own importance by extolling the greatness of his employer.  \"I worked for people who have no equal in Paris,\" said he proudly. \"They don't mince matters either, I can tell you; and they have more money than you could count in six months. There is not a thing they cannot do if they desire; and if I were to tell you----\"  He stopped short, his mouth wide open, and his eyes dilated with terror, for before him stood old Daddy Tantaine.  Tantaine's face had a most benign expression upon it, and in a most paternal voice he exclaimed,--  \"And so here you are at last, my lad; and, bless me, how fine! why, you look like a real swell.\"  But Toto was terribly disconcerted. The mere appearance of Tantaine dissipated the fumes of liquor which had hitherto clouded the boy's brain, and by degrees he recollected all that he had said, and, becoming conscious of his folly, had a vague idea of some swift-coming retribution. Toto was a sharp lad, and he was by no means deceived by Tantaine's outward semblance of friendliness, and he almost felt as if his life depended on the promptness of his decision. The question was, had the old man heard anything of the preceding conversation?  \"If the old rogue has been listening,\" said he to himself, \"I am in a hole, and no mistake.\"  It was, therefore, with a simulated air of ease that he answered,--  \"I was waiting for you, sir, and it was out of respect to you that I put on my very best togs.\"  \"That was very nice of you; I ought to thank you very much. And now, will you--\"  Toto's courage was coming back to him rapidly.  \"Will you take a glass of beer, or a liquor of brandy, sir?\" said he.  But Daddy Tantaine excused himself on the plea that he had just been drinking.  \"That is all the more reason for being thirsty,\" remarked Toto. \"My friends and I have drunk the contents of all these bottles since dinner.\"  Tantaine raised his shabby hat at this semi-introduction, and the two roughs bowed smoothly. They were not entirely satisfied with the appearance of the new-comer, and thought that this would be a good moment for taking leave of their host. The waltz had just concluded, and the master of the ceremonies was repeating his eternal refrain of--\"Take your places, ladies and gentlemen;\" and taking advantage of the noise, Toto's friends shook hands with their host and adroitly mixed with the crowd.  \"Good fellows! jolly fellows;\" muttered Toto, striving to catch a last glimpse of them.  Tantaine gave a low, derisive whistle. \"My lad,\" said he, \"you keep execrable company, and one day you will repent it.\"  \"I can look after myself, sir.\"  \"Do as you like, my lad; it is no business of mine. But, take my word for it, you will come to grief some day. I have told you that often enough.\"  \"If the old rascal suspected anything,\" thought Toto, \"he would not talk in this way.\"  Wretched Toto! he did not know that when his spirits were rising the danger was terribly near, for Tantaine was just then saying to himself,--  \"Ah! this lad is much too clever--too clever by half. If I were going on with the business, and could make it worth his while, how useful he would be to me! but just now it would be most imprudent to allow him to wander about and jabber when he gets drunk.\"  Meanwhile Toto had called a waiter, and, flinging a ten-franc piece on the table, said haughtily: \"Take your bill out of that.\" But Tantaine pushed the money back toward the lad, and, drawing another ten-franc piece from his pocket, gave it to the waiter.  This unexpected act of generosity put the lad in the best possible humor. \"All the better for me,\" exclaimed he; \"and now let us hunt up Caroline Schimmel.\"  \"Is she here? I could not find her.\"  \"Because you did not know where to look for her. She is at cards in the coffee-room. Come along, sir.\"  But Tantaine laid his hand upon the boy's arm.  \"One moment,\" said he. \"Did you tell the woman just what I ordered you to say?\"  \"I did not omit a single word.\"  \"Tell me what you said, then.\"  \"For five days,\" began the lad solemnly, \"your Toto has been your Caroline's shadow. We have played cards until all sorts of hours, and I took care that she should always win. I confided to her that I had a jolly old uncle,--a man not without means, a widower, and crazy to be married again,--who had seen her and had fallen in love with her.\"  \"Good! my lad, good! and what did she say?\"  \"Why, she grinned like half a dozen cats; only she is a bit artful, and I saw at once that she thought I was after her cards, but the mention of my uncle's property soon chucked her off that idea.\"  \"Did you give my name?\"  \"Yes, at the end, I did. I knew that she had seen you, and so I kept it back as long as I could; but as soon as I mentioned it she looked rather confused, and cried out: 'I know him quite well.' So you see, sir, all you have now is to settle a day for the marriage. Come on; she expects you.\"  Toto was right. The late domestic of the Duke de Champdoce was playing cards; but as soon as she caught sight of Toto and his pretended uncle, in spite of her holding an excellent hand, she threw up her cards, and received him with the utmost civility. Toto looked on with delight. Never had he seen the old rascal (as he inwardly called him in his heart) so polite, agreeable, and talkative. It was easy to see that Caroline Schimmel was yielding to his fascinations, for she had never had such extravagant compliments whispered in her ear in so persuasive a tone. But Tantaine did not confine his attentions to wine only: he first ordered a bowl of punch, and then followed that up by a bottle of the best brandy. All the old man's lost youth seemed to have come back to him: he sang, he drank, and he danced. Toto watched them in utter surprise, as the old man whirled the clumsy figure of the woman round the room.  And he was rewarded for this tremendous exertion, for by ten o'clock she had consented, and Caroline left the Grand Turk on the arm of her future husband, having promised to take supper with him.  Next morning, when the scavengers came down from Montmartre to ply their matutinal avocations, they found the body of a woman lying on her face on the pavement. They raised her up and carried her to an hospital. She was not dead, as had been at first supposed; and when the unhappy creature came to her senses, she said that her name was Caroline Schimmel, that she had been to supper at a restaurant with her betrothed, and that from that instant she remembered nothing. At her request, the surgeon had her conveyed to her home in the Rue Mercadet.    CHAPTER XXVII.  THE LAST LINK.  For some days M. Mascarin had not shown himself at the office, and Beaumarchef was terribly harassed with inquiries regarding his absent master. Mascarin, on the day after the evening on which Tantaine had met Caroline Schimmel at the Grand Turk, was carefully shut up in his private room; his face and eyes were red and inflamed, and he occasionally sipped a glass of some cooling beverage which stood before him, and his compressed lips and corrugated brow showed how deeply he was meditating. Suddenly the door opened, and Dr. Hortebise entered the room.  \"Well!\" exclaimed Mascarin, \"have you seen the Mussidans, as I told you to do.\"  \"Certainly,\" answered Hortebise briskly; \"I saw the Countess, and told her how pressing the holders of her letters were growing, and urged on her the necessity for immediate action. She told me that both she and her husband had determined to yield, and that Sabine, though evidently broken-hearted, would not oppose the marriage.\"  \"Good,\" said Mascarin; \"and now, if Croisenois only follows out the orders that I have given him, the marriage will take place without the knowledge of either De Breulh or Andre. Then we need fear them no longer. The prospectus of the new Company is ready, and can be issued almost immediately; but we meet to-day to discuss not that matter, but the more important one of the heir to the Champdoce title.\"  A timid knock at the door announced the arrival of Paul who came in hesitatingly, as if doubtful what sort of a reception he might receive; but Mascarin gave him the warmest possible welcome.  \"Permit me,\" said he, \"to offer you my congratulations on having won the affections of so estimable and wealthy a young lady as Mademoiselle Flavia. I may tell you that a friend of mine has informed me of the very flattering terms in which her father, M. Rigal, spoke of you, and I can assure you that if our mutual friend Dr. Hortebise were to go to the banker with an offer of marriage on your part, you have no cause to dread a refusal.\"  Paul blushed with pleasure, and as he was stammering out a few words, the door opened for the third time, and Catenac made his appearance. To cover the lateness of his arrival, he had clothed his face in smiles, and advanced with outstretched hands toward his confederates; but Mascarin's look and manner were so menacing, that he recoiled a few steps and gazed on him with an expression of the utmost wonder and surprise.  \"What is the meaning of this reception?\" asked he.  \"Can you not guess?\" returned Mascarin, his manner growing more and more threatening. \"I have sounded the lowest depths of your infamy. I was sure the other day that you meant to turn traitor, but you swore to the contrary, and you--\"  \"On my honor--\"  \"It is useless. One word from Perpignan set us on the right track. Were you or were you not ignorant that the Duke de Champdoce had a certain way of recognizing his son, and that was by a certain ineffaceable scar?\"  \"It had escaped my memory----\"  The words faded from his lips, for even his great self-command failed him under Mascarin's disdainful glance.  \"Let me tell you what I think of you,\" said the latter. \"I knew that you were a coward and a traitor. Even convicts keep faith with each other, and I had not thought you so utterly infamous.\"  \"Then why have you forced me to act contrary to my wishes?\"  This reply exasperated Mascarin so much that he grasped Catenac by the throat, and shook him violently.  \"I made use of you, you viper,\" said he, \"because I had placed you in such a position that you could not harm us. And now you will serve me because I will show you that I can take everything from you--name, money, liberty, and _life_. All depends upon our success. If we fail, you fall into an abyss of the depth and horrors of which you can have no conception. I knew with whom I had to deal, and took my measures accordingly. The most crushing proofs of your crime are in the hands of a person who has precise orders how to act. When I give the signal, he moves; and when he moves, you are utterly lost.\"  There was something so threatening in the silence that followed this speech that Paul grew faint with apprehension.  \"And,\" went on Mascarin, \"it would be an evil day for you if anything were to happen to Hortebise, Paul, or myself; for if one of us were to die suddenly, your fate would be sealed. You cannot say that you have not been warned.\"  Catenac stood with his head bent upon his breast, rooted to the ground with terror. He felt that he was bound, and gagged, and fettered hand and foot. Mascarin swallowed some of the cooling draught that stood before him, and tranquilly commenced,--  \"Suppose, Catenac, that I were to tell you that I know far more of the Champdoce matter than you do; for, after all, your knowledge is only derived from what the Duke has told you. You think that you have hit upon the truth; you were never more mistaken in your life. I, perhaps you are unaware, have been many years engaged in this matter. Perhaps you would like to know how I first thought of the affair. Do you remember that solicitor who had an office near the Law Courts, and did a great deal of blackmail business? If you do, you must remember that he got two years' hard labor.\"  \"Yes, I remember the man,\" returned Catenac in a humble voice.  \"He used,\" continued Mascarin, \"to buy up waste paper, and search through the piles he had collected for any matters that might be concealed in the heterogeneous mass. And many things he must have found. In what sensational case have not letters played a prominent part? What man is there who has not at one time or other regretted that he has had pen and ink ready to his hand? If men were wise, they would use those patent inks, which fade from the paper in a few days. I followed his example, and, among other strange discoveries, I made this one.\"  He took from his desk a piece of paper--ragged, dirty, and creased--and, handing it to Hortebise and Paul, said,--  \"Read!\"  They did so, and read the following strange word:  \"TNAFNEERTONIOMZEDNEREITIPZEYAETNECONNISIUSEJECARG;\"  while underneath was written in another hand the word, \"Never.\"  \"It was evident that I had in my hands a letter written in cipher, and I concluded that the paper contained some important secret.\"  Catenac listened to this narrative with an air of contempt, for he was one of those foolish men who never know when it is best for them to yield.  \"I daresay you are right,\" answered he with a slight sneer.  \"Thank you,\" returned Mascarin coolly. \"At any rate, I was deeply interested in solving this riddle, the more as I belonged to an association which owes its being and position to its skill in penetrating the secrets of others. I shut myself up in my room, and vowed that I would not leave it until I had worked out the cipher.\"  Paul, Hortebise, and Catenac examined the letter curiously, but could make nothing of it.  \"I can't make head or tail of it,\" said the doctor impatiently.  Mascarin smiled as he took back the paper, and remarked,--  \"At first I was as much puzzled as you were, and more than once was tempted to throw the document into the waste-paper basket, but a secret feeling that it opened a way to all our fortunes restrained me. Of course there was the chance that I might only decipher some foolish jest, and no secret at all, but still I went on. If the commencement of the word was written in a woman's hand, the last word had evidently been added by a man. But why should a cryptogram have been used? Was it because the demand was of so dangerous and compromising a character that it was impossible to put it in plain language? If so, why was the last word not in cipher? Simply because the mere rejection of what was certainly a demand would in no manner compromise the writer. You will ask how it happens that demand and rejection are both on the same sheet of paper. I thought this over, and came to the conclusion that the letter had once been meant for the post, but had been sent by hand. Perhaps the writers may have occupied rooms in the same house. The woman, in the anguish of her soul, may have sent the letter by a servant to her husband, and he, transported by rage, may have hurriedly scrawled this word across it, and returned it again: 'Take this to your mistress.' Having settled this point, I attacked the cipher, and, after fourteen hours' hard work, hit upon its meaning.  \"Accidentally I held the piece of paper between myself and the light, with the side on which the writing was turned from me, and read it at once. It was a cryptogram of the simplest kind, as the letters forming the words were simply reversed. I divided the letters into words, and made out this sentence: '_Grace, je suis innocente. Ayez pitie; rendez-moi notre enfant_ (Mercy, I am innocent. Give me back our son).'\"  Hortebise snatched up the paper and glanced at it.  \"You are right,\" said he; \"it is the art of cipher writing in its infancy.\"  \"I had succeeded in reading it,--but how to make use of it! The mass of waste paper in which I found it had been purchased from a servant in a country house near Vendome. A friend of mine, who was accustomed to drawing plans and maps, came to my aid, and discovered some faint signs of a crest in one corner of the paper. With the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, I discovered it to be the cognizance of the ducal house of Champdoce. The light that guided me was faint and uncertain, and many another man would have given up the quest. But the thought was with me in my waking hours, and was the companion of my pillow during the dark hours of the night. Six months later I knew that it was the Duchess who had addressed this missive to her husband, and why she had done so. By degrees I learned all the secret to which this scrap of paper gave me the clue; and if I have been a long while over it, it is because one link was wanting which I only discovered yesterday.\"  \"Ah,\" said the doctor, \"then Caroline Schimmel has spoken.\"  \"Yes; drink was the magician that disclosed the secret that for twenty years she had guarded with unswerving fidelity.\"  As Mascarin uttered these words he opened a drawer, and drew from it a large pile of manuscript, which he waved over his head with an air of triumph.  \"This is the greatest work that I have ever done,\" exclaimed he. \"Listen to it, Hortebise, and you shall see how it is that I hold firmly, at the same time, both the Duke and Duchess of Champdoce, and Diana the Countess of Mussidan. Listen to me, Catenac,--you who distrusted me, and were ready to play the traitor, and tell me if I do not grasp success in my strong right hand.\" Then, holding out the roll of papers to Paul, he cried, \"And do you, my dear boy, take this and read it carefully. Let nothing escape you, for there is not one item, however trivial it may seem to you, that has not its importance. It is the history of a great and noble house, and one in which you are more interested than you may think.\"  Paul opened the manuscript, and, in a voice which quivered with emotion, he read the facts announced by Mascarin, which he had entitled \"The Mystery of Champdoce.\"   [The conclusion of this exciting narrative will be found in the volume called \"The Mystery of Champdoce.\"]",

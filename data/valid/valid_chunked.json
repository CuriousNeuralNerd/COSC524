There was a lazy murmur of bees in the flower-borders, a gentle cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms. From distant lawns came the whir of a mowing-machine, that most restful of all country sounds; making ease the sweeter in that it is taken while others are working.  It was the hour when even those whose business it is to attend to the wants of others have a",

Audrey nodded. She took a pin from her mouth, found a place in the hat for it, and said, \"He likes a bit of pink.\"  \"I don't say I mind a bit of pink myself,\" said her aunt. \"Joe Turner isn't the only one.\"  \"It isn't everybody's colour,\" said",
